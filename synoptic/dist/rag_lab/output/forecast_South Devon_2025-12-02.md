Today in South Devon, Bantham is the star with a solid 5ft @ 8s SW swell and light 5 mph WSW winds, making for clean conditions. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3ft @ 8s with similar light winds, still offering some fun at Bantham, Bovisand Reef, and Challborough. Day after, expect a slight increase to 4ft @ 8s, with winds easing to 5 mph W, keeping it clean across the same spots. Best: today.
