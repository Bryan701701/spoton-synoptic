Today in South Devon, Bantham is lighting up with a solid 5ft @8s SW swell and light 5 mph WSW winds, making for clean conditions. Tomorrow, expect a slight drop to 3ft @8s, still workable at Bantham and nearby spots like Bovisand Reef and Challborough, with winds picking up to 7 mph WSW. Day after, swell bumps back to 4ft @8s across the same spots, with light 5 mph W winds keeping it fun. Best: today.
