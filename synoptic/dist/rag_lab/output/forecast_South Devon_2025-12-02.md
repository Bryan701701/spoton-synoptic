Today in South Devon, Bantham is lighting up with a solid 5 ft @ 8s SW swell and light 5 mph WSW winds, making for clean conditions. Tomorrow, expect a slight drop to 3 ft @ 8s with similar winds, still offering fun waves at Bantham, Bovisand Reef, and Challborough. Day after, the swell picks back up to 4 ft @ 8s, maintaining light W winds, keeping the surf lively at all three spots. Best: today.
