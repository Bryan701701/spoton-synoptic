Today in South Devon, Bantham is lighting up with a solid 5 ft @ 8s SW swell and light 5 mph WSW winds, making for clean conditions. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 8s, still workable at Bantham, Bovisand Reef, and Challborough with light winds. The day after sees a slight bump back to 4 ft @ 8s, with similar light winds across the spots. Best: today.
