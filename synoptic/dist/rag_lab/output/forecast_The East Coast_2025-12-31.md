The East Coast is lighting up today with clean 2 ft @11s NNE swell at Aberdeen Harbour, thanks to a moderate 12 mph W wind. It's a great time to hit the water, especially between 08:47 and 15:34. Tomorrow sees a drop in conditions with poor surf at 2 ft @5s NW and fresh 26 mph NW winds, making it a day to skip. The day after also looks poor with 3 ft @7s N and 20 mph NNW winds, so keep your boards dry. Best: today.
