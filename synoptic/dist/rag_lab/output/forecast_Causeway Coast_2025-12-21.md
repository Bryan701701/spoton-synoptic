Today on the Causeway Coast, White Park Bay and Portballintrae are both working with a solid 6 ft @ 13s WNW swell and a moderate 13 mph SE wind. Best conditions are during the mid-day push. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @ 11s with fresh 21 mph E winds, making it poor across the board. The day after, the swell continues to fade to 2 ft @ 10s, still with ESE winds, but there are some workable corners at White Park Bay and Portballintrae. Best: today.
