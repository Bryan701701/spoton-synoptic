Today in North Devon, conditions are poor with 4 ft @12s W swell and fresh 21 mph S winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @8s WSW with moderate 17 mph SW winds, offering some workable corners like Woolacombe and Croyde Beach during the morning tide. The day after, expect bigger 7 ft @10s SW swell but with strong 31 mph S winds, making it challenging. Best: tomorrow.
