Today in North Devon, conditions are poor with 4 ft @12s W swell but fresh 21 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 4 ft @8s WSW swell and moderate 17 mph SW winds; expect workable conditions at spots like Woolacombe and Croyde Beach during the morning push. The day after, conditions drop again with 7 ft @10s SW swell, but strong 31 mph S winds will make it challenging. Best: tomorrow.
