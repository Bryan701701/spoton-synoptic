North Devon is looking fun today with 3 ft @6s WNW swell and moderate 11 mph WNW winds. Woolacombe and Putsborough are your best bets, both holding shape from 08:19 to 16:28. Tomorrow sees a drop to 5 ft @7s, but fresh 26 mph NW winds will make it blown out across the board. Day after brings 4 ft @9s with lighter 13 mph NNW winds, making for a more manageable surf day. Best: today.
