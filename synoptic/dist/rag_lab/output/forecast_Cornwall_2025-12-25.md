Today, Cornwall is seeing poor conditions with 4 ft @6s NNE swell across the North, but fresh 39 mph NE winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @7s N with light 10 mph E winds, still not producing much. By the day after, we see a slight improvement with 5 ft @6s E swell, but the wind remains fresh at 14 mph ENE. Best: day after.
