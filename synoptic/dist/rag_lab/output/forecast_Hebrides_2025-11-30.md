Today in the Hebrides, it's looking great with 5 ft @10s NNW swell and light 5 mph NE winds. Tolsta and Port of Ness are prime spots, offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 6 ft @9s WSW but with fresh 16 mph SSW winds, making it a bit choppy—still workable at sheltered spots like Europie and Barvas. Day after, the swell increases to 9 ft @12s WSW, but strong 22 mph S winds will make it blown out across the board. Best: today.
