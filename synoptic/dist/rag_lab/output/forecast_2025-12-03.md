Today on the West Coast, it's looking good with 5 ft @11s WNW swell and fresh 18 mph SSW winds. Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay are your best bets, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @9s, but conditions will be clean with lighter 11 mph W winds. The day after, expect 7 ft @13s W swell, but fresh 22 mph S winds will make it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
