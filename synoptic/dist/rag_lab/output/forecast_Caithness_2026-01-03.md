Today in Caithness, it’s looking poor with 4 ft @6s NNE swell, but fresh 42 mph NNW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @6s with 25 mph NNW winds, still not producing much. By the day after, we’ll see a bit of improvement with 6 ft @9s NNW swell and lighter 17 mph N winds at spots like Point of Ness and Thurso East. Best: day after.
