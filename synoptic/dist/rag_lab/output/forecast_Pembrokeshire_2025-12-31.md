Today in Pembrokeshire, clean conditions at St Brides Bay and Tenby with 1ft @12s WSW swell and light ENE winds. Great for a fun session, especially around mid-tide. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 2ft @6s WNW, but fresh NW winds will make it blown out across the coast. The day after, similar conditions persist with 2ft @5s WNW and continued fresh winds. Best: today.
