North Devon is looking fun today with 3 ft @ 9s WSW swell and light 11 mph SSE winds. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are both good options, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 5 ft @ 14s with light winds, making it a great day for all spots. However, day after sees a strong 7 ft swell but with fresh 23 mph WSW winds, likely making it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
