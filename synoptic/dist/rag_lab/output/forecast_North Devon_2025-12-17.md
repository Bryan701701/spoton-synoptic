Today in North Devon, it's looking fun with 3 ft @ 9s WSW across the spots, and light SSE winds at 11 mph keeping it clean. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are solid choices, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 5 ft @ 14s with light winds, making for a great day at Woolacombe or Croyde Beach. Day after, however, the conditions deteriorate with 7 ft @ 10s and fresh WSW winds, likely making it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
