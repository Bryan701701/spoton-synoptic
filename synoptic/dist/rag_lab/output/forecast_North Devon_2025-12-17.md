North Devon is looking solid today with 3 ft @ 9s WSW swell and light SSE winds at 11 mph. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are great picks, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 5 ft @ 14s with lighter winds, making it a prime day for all spots. Day after, expect 7 ft @ 10s, but fresh WSW winds will likely blow it out. Best: tomorrow.
