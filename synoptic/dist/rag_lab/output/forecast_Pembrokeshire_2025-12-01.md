Today in Pembrokeshire, conditions are poor with an 8 ft @ 8s SW swell and fresh 29 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the surf improves to 7 ft @ 9s WSW with light 9 mph SW winds, offering clean and fun waves at spots like Whitesands Bay and Freshwater West. The day after, surf drops to 6 ft @ 11s WSW with moderate 15 mph WSW winds, still providing workable conditions at sheltered corners. Best: tomorrow.
