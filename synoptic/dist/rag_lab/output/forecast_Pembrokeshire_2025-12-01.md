Today in Pembrokeshire, conditions are poor with 5 ft @8s SW swell and fresh 30 mph SSW winds. It's blown out across the coast, so best to give it a miss. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 6 ft @9s WSW swell and 20 mph SSW winds, but still not ideal. Day after brings better prospects with 7 ft @10s WSW swell and lighter 13 mph W winds, making it more workable. Best: day after.
