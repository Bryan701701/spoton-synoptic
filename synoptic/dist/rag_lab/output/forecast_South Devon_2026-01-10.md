Today in South Devon, Bantham is lighting up with a solid 4ft @ 8s WSW swell and light 7 mph NW winds, making for clean conditions. Tomorrow, expect a drop to 3ft @ 5s SSW with fresh 28 mph onshore winds, so it’ll be blown out. Day after, conditions improve with 6ft @ 8s SW swell and 18 mph SW winds; still a bit breezy but workable at Bantham and nearby spots. Best: today.
