County Sligo is looking solid over the next three days! Today, Strandhill and Easkey Left are both clean at 3 ft @ 12s WNW with light 7 mph SSE winds, perfect for some fun sessions. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 3 ft but drops to 10s; still good at the same spots with slightly stronger winds at 9 mph SSE. On the day after, conditions drop with the swell at 3 ft @ 8s WSW and fresh 11 mph SSW winds, making it less inviting. Best: today.
