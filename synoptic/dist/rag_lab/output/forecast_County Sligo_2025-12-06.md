Today in County Sligo, Strandhill and Easkey Left are lighting up with 3ft @12s WNW swell and light 7 mph SSE winds, making for clean conditions. Tomorrow, expect similar 3ft @10s WNW swell with slightly stronger 9 mph SSE winds—still fun at the same spots. Day after, conditions drop with 3ft @8s WSW swell and fresh 11 mph SSW winds, leading to less favorable surf. Best: today.
