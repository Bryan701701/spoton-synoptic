Today in County Sligo, Strandhill and Easkey Left are both clean and fun at 3 ft @ 12s WNW, with light 7 mph SSE winds. Tomorrow, expect similar conditions with a slight drop to 3 ft @ 10s WNW, still offering good surf at the same spots. Day after looks less promising, with all spots showing poor conditions due to onshore winds and shorter period swell. Best: today.
