Today in County Sligo, surf's looking good with 3 ft @ 12s WNW swell and light 7 mph SSE winds. Strandhill and Easkey Left are the top picks, both offering clean conditions. Tomorrow, expect similar 3 ft @ 10s WNW swell with a slight increase in wind to 9 mph SSE, keeping it fun at the same spots. On the day after, conditions drop with 3 ft @ 8s WSW swell and fresh 11 mph SSW winds, making it less favorable. Best: today.
