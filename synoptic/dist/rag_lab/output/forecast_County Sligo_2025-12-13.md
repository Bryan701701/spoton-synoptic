Today in County Sligo, it's a bit rough with 7 ft @13s WNW swell and fresh 26 mph S winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 5 ft @10s with 29 mph SSW winds, still not ideal. However, day after brings a nice change with 5 ft @12s WNW swell and light 9 mph S winds, offering clean conditions at spots like Strandhill and Easkey. Best: day after.
