Today in County Sligo, it's a tough call with 7 ft @13s WNW swell, but fresh 26 mph S winds have it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 5 ft @10s W, still messy with 29 mph SSW winds. By the day after, conditions improve with 5 ft @12s WNW and light 9 mph S winds, offering some clean options at spots like Strandhill and Easkey. Best: day after.
