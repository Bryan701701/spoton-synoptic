Today on the West Coast, conditions are poor with 5 ft @10s WNW swell and fresh 19 mph SW winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees an increase to 8 ft @13s W, but the fresh 21 mph SW wind continues to create messy conditions. By the day after, the swell drops back to 5 ft @8s WSW with strong 41 mph S winds, keeping it challenging. Best: tomorrow.
