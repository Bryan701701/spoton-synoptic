South Devon is looking good today with Bantham offering clean 2 ft @5s SW lines and light 9 mph NW winds. Tomorrow, expect a bit more action as swell builds to 3 ft @6s WSW, still with manageable winds at 11 mph W. By the day after, the swell peaks at 5 ft @8s WSW, but watch for fresh 17 mph WNW winds making it a bit choppy. Best: tomorrow.
