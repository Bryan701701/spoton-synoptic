Today in Cornwall, the West coast is seeing some action with 8 ft @ 10s WSW swell at Sennen Cove and Gwenvor, both working well under a light 16 mph WNW wind. Best conditions are early on the push, especially from 09:01 to 13:26. Tomorrow, conditions improve further with 7 ft @ 13s W swell and light winds, making for a great day at spots like Crantock and Porthcurno. The day after, expect a drop in size with 7 ft @ 10s W swell, but fresh onshore winds will make it less appealing. Best: tomorrow.
