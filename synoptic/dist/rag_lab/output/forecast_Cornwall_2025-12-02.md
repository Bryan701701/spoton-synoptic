Today in Cornwall, the West coast is seeing some action with Sennen Cove and Gwenvor both offering 8 ft @ 10s WSW, thanks to a moderate 16 mph WNW wind. It’s best to hit these spots during the early tides from 09:01 to 13:26. Tomorrow, conditions improve with clean 7 ft @ 13s W swells across the North and South, with light 9 mph S winds making it a great day for surf. The day after, expect a drop to 4 ft @ 9s W with fresh 17 mph W winds, keeping it challenging. Best: tomorrow.
