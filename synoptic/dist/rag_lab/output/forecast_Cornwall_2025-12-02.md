Today, the West is looking solid with 8 ft @10s WSW swell and a light 16 mph WNW wind. Sennen Cove and Gwenvor are clean and fun early, best on the push from 09:01–13:26. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 7 ft @13s W and light 9 mph S winds, making for great surf at spots like Crantock and Porthcurno. Day after, the swell drops to 4 ft @9s, but still some workable waves at Porthcurno and Praa Sands. Best: tomorrow.
