North Devon is lighting up today with 4 ft @10s W swell and light NNW winds at 10 mph. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are both offering fun conditions, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @8s WNW with a moderate NW wind, making it workable but less exciting. By the day after, conditions worsen with 4 ft @7s SW swell and fresh SSW winds at 24 mph, leading to blown-out surf. Best: today.
