The North East is looking solid today with clean 3 ft @9s NNE swell and light 10 mph SSW winds. Great spots like Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands are firing, especially between 09:04 and 16:41. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @8s NE with similar winds, making Saltburn Beach the standout option again. By the day after, conditions ease further to 2 ft @6s E, but still some fun to be had at sheltered corners. Best: today.
