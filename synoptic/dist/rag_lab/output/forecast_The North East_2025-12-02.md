Today in the North East, it's looking fun with 3 ft @ 9s NNE swell and a light 10 mph SSW wind. Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands are your best bets, offering clean conditions from 09:04 to 16:41. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 8s NE with a moderate 12 mph SSW wind; Saltburn Beach remains the standout spot. By the day after, expect similar 2 ft @ 6s E conditions, but with a bit more wind at 13 mph SSE; still workable at Saltburn and Coatham. Best: today.
