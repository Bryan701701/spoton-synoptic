Today, the North East is lighting up with 3 ft @9s NNE swell and light SSW winds, making for clean conditions at spots like Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands. Tomorrow, expect a drop to 2 ft @8s with similar SSW winds, still workable at Saltburn Beach. Day after, conditions ease further to 2 ft @6s with SSE winds, but still some fun peaks at sheltered spots. Best: today.
