Today, the North East is lighting up with clean 3 ft @ 9s NNE swell and light 10 mph SSW winds. Great options at Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands, both offering fun waves throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 8s NE with similar winds, keeping it mellow but still surfable at Saltburn Beach. Day after, conditions ease further to 2 ft @ 6s E, with a bit more wind, making it a quieter day overall. Best: today.
