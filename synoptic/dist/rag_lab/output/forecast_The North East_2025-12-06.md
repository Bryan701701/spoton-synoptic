Today in the North East, Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach are lighting up with 3 ft @ 7s ESE, thanks to a fresh 17 mph S wind. Expect clean conditions early, especially around the tides. Tomorrow, things drop to 1 ft @ 6s ENE, making it a quiet day across the coast. By the day after, Saltburn Beach shows a little life with 1 ft @ 5s N, but still not much to ride. Best: today.
