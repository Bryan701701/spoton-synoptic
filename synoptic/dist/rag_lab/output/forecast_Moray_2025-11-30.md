Today in Moray, it’s a bit of a struggle with fresh 23 mph NNW winds creating a blown-out scene at 4 ft @ 7s NNE. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 3 ft @ 6s E, but still fresh SSE winds keeping it choppy. The day after, conditions get even better with 2 ft @ 10s NNE and light 6 mph SE winds, making it the best day to catch some fun waves at spots like Spey Bay and Lossiemouth. Best: day after.
