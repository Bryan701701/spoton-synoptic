Today in North Yorks, surf is small but clean at 1 ft @8s with a fresh 15 mph WSW wind. Withernsea, Filey, and Whitby Beach are all working, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow sees a drop to 2 ft @4s with fresh SSW winds, making conditions poor across the board. The day after continues the trend with similar conditions, so it’s best to enjoy today’s surf. Best: today.
