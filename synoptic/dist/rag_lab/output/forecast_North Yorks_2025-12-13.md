Today in North Yorks, it's small but clean with 1 ft @ 8s N swell and fresh 15 mph WSW winds. Withernsea and Filey are your best bets, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow sees a drop to 2 ft @ 4s SSW, but the fresh winds will keep it blown out. Day after, similar conditions persist with 2 ft @ 4s S, still not ideal. Best: today.
