Today on the East Coast, conditions are poor with 3 ft @5s S swell and fresh 20 mph S wind. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 3 ft @6s SSE swell and 16 mph SSW wind, but still not producing great surf. The day after, the swell picks up to 4 ft @7s SSE, but with stronger 23 mph SSW winds, it’s likely to be blown out. Best: tomorrow.
