Today on the West Coast, it's a quiet day with 2 ft @9s W swell and fresh 8 mph ENE wind. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 2 ft @9s NW swell and moderate 17 mph E wind; some sheltered spots like Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay might offer workable waves. The day after, the swell remains at 2 ft but shifts to 12s WNW, with light 7 mph NNE wind, keeping it on the poor side. Best: tomorrow.
