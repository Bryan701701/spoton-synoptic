Today in the Hebrides, Europie and Barvas are lighting up with 7 ft @10s NW swell and fresh 15 mph SW winds. Best times to hit are mid-tide, especially from 09:04–14:11 for Europie. Tomorrow, conditions drop as the swell remains but the wind picks up to 21 mph WSW, making it blown out across the board. Day after, the swell eases to 6 ft @11s WSW with 17 mph SW winds, still offering some fun at spots like Europie and Barvas. Best: today.
