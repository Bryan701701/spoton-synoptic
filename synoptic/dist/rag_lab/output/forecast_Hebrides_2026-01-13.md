Today in the Hebrides, we have a solid 7 ft @10s NW swell with fresh 15 mph SW winds. Europie and Barvas are your best bets, both working well throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop as the swell remains but the wind picks up to 21 mph WSW, making it blown out across the region. On the day after, the swell eases to 6 ft @11s WSW with moderate 17 mph SW winds, still offering some fun at spots like Europie and Barvas. Best: today.
