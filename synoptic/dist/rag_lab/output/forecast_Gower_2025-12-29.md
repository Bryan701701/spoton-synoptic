Today on Gower, conditions are poor with 2 ft @7s E swell and fresh 8 mph ENE winds. Tomorrow, the swell remains at 2 ft @8s SSE but with stronger 26 mph E winds, making it blown out. By the day after, Llangennith Beach and Oxwich Bay show some promise with 1 ft @12s WSW and lighter 10 mph ENE winds, offering a better chance for a fun session. Best: day after.
