Today, the North East is experiencing poor conditions with 4 ft @8s NNE swell, but fresh 27 mph S winds are making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees a drop to 2 ft @9s with 19 mph SSW winds, still not producing much. By the day after, conditions improve slightly with 2 ft @6s ESE at Saltburn Beach, offering a workable option during the tides. Best: day after.
