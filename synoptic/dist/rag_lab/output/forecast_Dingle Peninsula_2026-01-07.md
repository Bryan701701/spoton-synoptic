Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it's looking good with 6 ft @8s NW swell and a moderate 12 mph WNW wind. Ballybunion Right and Ballybunion Beach are the top picks, especially during the tides from 08:48–12:41 and 14:11–16:42. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 5 ft @9s with light 6 mph SSW winds, making for a clean day at the same spots. On the day after, expect 8 ft @9s W swell, but fresh 27 mph WNW winds will likely blow it out. Best: today.
