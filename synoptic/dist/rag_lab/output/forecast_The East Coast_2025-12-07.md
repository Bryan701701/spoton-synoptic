The East Coast is looking good today with clean 3 ft @ 7s ESE swell and light 3 mph NNW winds. Spots like Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay are prime from 09:14 to 15:35. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 3 ft @ 6s with a light 7 mph SSW breeze, still offering fun conditions at the same spots. Day after, it’s a different story with only 1 ft @ 4s, so best to give it a miss. Best: today.
