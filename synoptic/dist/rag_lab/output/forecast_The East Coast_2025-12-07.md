The East Coast is looking solid today with clean 3 ft @ 7s ESE swell and light 3 mph NNW winds. Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay are prime spots, especially between 09:14 and 15:35. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 3 ft @ 6s with SSW winds at 7 mph, still providing good conditions at the same spots. By the day after, conditions fade to 1 ft @ 4s, making it a quiet day across the coast. Best: today.
