Today in Caithness, it's a bit of a struggle with poor conditions: 5 ft @ 6s SSW swell and fresh 35 mph SSW winds making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, things improve slightly with 9 ft @ 10s NNW swell and moderate 17 mph NNW winds, offering some workable waves at spots like Point of Ness and Thurso East. By the day after, the swell drops to 5 ft @ 9s NNW with light 15 mph NE winds, still providing decent options at sheltered corners. Best: tomorrow.
