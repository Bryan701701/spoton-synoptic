Today in Moray, conditions are poor with 2 ft @5s WSW swell and fresh 13 mph S winds across the board. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 1 ft @11s NNE swell; however, it's still not producing much, with only Spey Bay and Lossiemouth offering some minor options. The day after, conditions drop back to 2 ft @5s WSW with fresh 23 mph S winds, making it blown out again. Best: tomorrow.
