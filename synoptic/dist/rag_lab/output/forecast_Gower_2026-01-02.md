Today in Gower, it's a bit of a struggle with 3 ft @5s WNW swell, but fresh 24 mph NW winds are making it messy across the board. Tomorrow sees a drop to 2 ft @5s NW with continued 20 mph NW winds, keeping things on the poor side. By the day after, we're down to 1 ft @8s WSW, with 14 mph N winds adding to the challenge. Best: today.
