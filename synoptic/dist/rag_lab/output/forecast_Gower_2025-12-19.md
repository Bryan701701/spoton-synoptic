Today in Gower, it's a bit rough with 9 ft @10s WSW swell and fresh 21 mph WSW winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 5 ft @8s SW, but the fresh 23 mph SSE wind keeps it messy. Day after, conditions improve with 6 ft @12s WSW and lighter 11 mph SE winds, offering clean surf at spots like Llangennith Beach. Best: day after.
