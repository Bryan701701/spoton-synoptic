Today in Moray, we're seeing some fun 2 ft @ 6s NNW lines with a fresh 17 mph NNW wind. Fraserburgh and Pennan are your best bets, working nicely throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @ 7s NNE with a stronger 21 mph N wind, making it a bit blown out. By the day after, we bounce back to 3 ft @ 7s ENE with a lighter 16 mph SSE wind, offering cleaner options again. Best: today.
