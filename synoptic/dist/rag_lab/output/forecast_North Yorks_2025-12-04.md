Today is looking poor across North Yorks with 2 ft @6s ESE swell and fresh 24 mph SSE winds. Tomorrow brings a slight improvement with the same swell size but winds easing to 18 mph S, making it a bit more workable, especially around mid-tide windows. Unfortunately, the day after returns to similar conditions with 2 ft @6s SE swell and 19 mph S winds, keeping it on the poor side. Best: tomorrow.
