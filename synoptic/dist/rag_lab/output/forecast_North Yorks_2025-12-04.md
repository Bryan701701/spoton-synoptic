Today in North Yorks, it's looking poor with 2 ft @6s ESE swell and fresh 24 mph SSE winds across all spots. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with similar swell but lighter 18 mph S winds; Withernsea and Filey may offer some workable conditions during the tide windows. The day after continues the trend with 2 ft @6s SE swell and 19 mph S winds, keeping it on the poor side. Best: tomorrow.
