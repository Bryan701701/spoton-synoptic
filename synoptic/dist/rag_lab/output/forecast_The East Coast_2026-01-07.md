Today on the East Coast, it's a bit rough with fresh 37 mph ENE winds creating a blown-out situation. The swell is 5 ft @ 7s, but it's not producing anything clean. Tomorrow, conditions improve significantly with 4 ft @ 8s E swell and light 5 mph WSW winds, making it a great day for a surf session at spots like Coldinham Bay. The day after continues the trend with similar 4 ft @ 6s E swell and light 5 mph WNW winds, keeping it fun and workable. Best: tomorrow.
