Today on the East Coast, conditions are poor with 5 ft @7s ENE swell and fresh 37 mph ENE winds, making it blown out and not producing. Tomorrow, the surf improves to 4 ft @8s E with light 5 mph WSW winds, offering clean and fun conditions at spots like Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay. Day after, it stays consistent with 4 ft @6s E and light 5 mph WNW winds, still providing good options at the same spots. Best: tomorrow.
