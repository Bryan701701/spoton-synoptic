Today in Caithness, it's a challenging surf day with 6 ft @6s NW swell, but fresh 30 mph NNW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 4 ft @6s NNE swell and lighter 18 mph NNE winds, offering some workable conditions at spots like Thurso East and Sandside Bay. The day after, conditions drop again to 5 ft @6s N with strong 35 mph NNW winds, making it another tough day. Best: tomorrow.
