Today in Caithness, it's a bit rough with fresh NNW winds at 30 mph and 6 ft @ 6s NW swell. The conditions are blown out, so it's best to give it a miss. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 4 ft @ 6s NNE swell and lighter 18 mph NNE winds, making for some workable corners like Sinclair's Bay and Sandside Bay. The day after, conditions drop again with 5 ft @ 6s N swell and fresh 35 mph NNW winds, leading to poor surf. Best: tomorrow.
