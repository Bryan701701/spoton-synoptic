Today in County Sligo, it's a tough call with fresh N winds at 24 mph and 7 ft @ 9s N swell making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with winds picking up to 28 mph, keeping the surf messy and unworkable. However, day after shows some promise as the swell drops to 4 ft @ 9s with lighter NNW winds at 13 mph, making for better conditions at spots like Dunmoran Strand and Easkey. Best: day after.
