Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking solid with 6 ft @ 8s NNW swell and fresh 18 mph NNW winds. White Park Bay and Portballintrae are your best bets, especially during the tide windows from 08:52 to 16:06. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 7 ft @ 8s NNW swell but fresh 29 mph NNW winds will make it blown out and poor. The day after continues with similar poor conditions, 7 ft @ 8s NNW and 25 mph N winds. Best: today.
