Today in Cornwall, the North is looking clean with 1ft @12s W lines at Town and Watergate Bay, both best on the early tides from 08:21 to 16:25. The South has some workable options too, with Kennack Sands and Falmouth offering 2ft @7s SSE, best around the early and mid-day tides. Tomorrow, expect a slight uptick to 2ft @6s WNW across the North, while the South drops to 1ft, not quite hitting the mark. By the day after, conditions worsen with 3ft @6s NW but fresh winds will make it blown out. Best: today.
