Today in County Sligo, surf is on with 7 ft @ 13s WNW at Strandhill and Easkey, but fresh 15 mph S winds create some chop. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 7 ft @ 11s WNW and lighter 8 mph S winds, making for cleaner waves at Strandhill and Easkey. By the day after, surf drops to 4 ft @ 10s NW, still fun but with a bit more wind. Best: tomorrow.
