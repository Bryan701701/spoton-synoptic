Today in County Sligo, we have a solid 7 ft @ 13s WNW swell with fresh 15 mph S winds. Strandhill and Easkey spots are working, with best tides from 09:33 to 17:15. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 7 ft but drops to 11s, with lighter 8 mph S winds, making for cleaner conditions. Day after, the swell eases to 4 ft @ 10s NW, still fun at Strandhill and Easkey Left. Best: tomorrow.
