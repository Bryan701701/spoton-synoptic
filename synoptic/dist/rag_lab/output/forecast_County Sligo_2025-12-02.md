Today in County Sligo, expect solid surf with 7 ft @ 13s WNW swell and fresh 15 mph S winds. Strandhill and Easkey spots are working well, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow brings similar conditions with 7 ft @ 11s WNW and lighter 8 mph S winds, making for a cleaner session. Day after, the swell drops to 4 ft @ 10s NW, still fun at Strandhill and Easkey Left with moderate W winds. Best: tomorrow.
