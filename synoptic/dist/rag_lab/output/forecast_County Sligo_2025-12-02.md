Today in County Sligo, we have 7 ft @ 13s WNW swell with a fresh 15 mph S wind. It’s a bit blown out, but sheltered corners like Strandhill and Easkey Right are still working. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 7 ft @ 11s WNW swell and lighter 8 mph S winds, making for cleaner waves at Strandhill and Easkey Left. Day after, the swell drops to 4 ft @ 10s NW, but still fun at Strandhill and Easkey Left with moderate W winds. Best: tomorrow.
