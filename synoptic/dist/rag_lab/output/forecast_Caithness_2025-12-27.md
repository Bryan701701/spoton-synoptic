Today in Caithness, it's a quiet day with 1ft @7s SW lines across most spots, and fresh 13 mph NNW winds creating some chop. Tomorrow, conditions improve significantly with 4ft @10s NNW swell and light 7 mph W winds, making for clean surf at spots like Point of Ness and Thurso East. The day after continues the good vibes with similar 4ft @9s NNW swell and moderate 11 mph N winds, keeping the surf fun and rideable. Best: tomorrow.
