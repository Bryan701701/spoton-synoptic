Today on the East Coast, it's a quiet one with 1 ft @5s SE swell and fresh 13 mph SSE winds—definitely not producing. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 5 ft @6s S swell, but the fresh 24 mph SSW wind will make it blown out. By the day after, we see 3 ft @5s SSW swell with moderate 15 mph SSW winds; Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay might offer some workable waves during the tide window. Best: day after.
