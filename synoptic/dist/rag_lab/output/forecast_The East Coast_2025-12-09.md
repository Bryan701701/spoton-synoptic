Today on the East Coast, it's a quiet scene with 1 ft @5s SE swell and fresh 13 mph SSE winds. Tomorrow, we see a bump to 5 ft @6s S, but with strong 24 mph SSW winds, expect it to be blown out. By the day after, conditions improve slightly with 3 ft @5s SSW, and while the wind eases to 15 mph, only a few spots like Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay will be workable. Best: day after.
