Today on the East Coast, it's a quiet scene with 1 ft @5s SE swell and fresh 13 mph SSE winds—definitely not producing. Tomorrow, conditions pick up slightly with 5 ft @6s S swell, but the fresh 24 mph SSW wind will make it blown out. By the day after, we see 3 ft @5s SSW swell with a more manageable 15 mph SSW wind, offering some workable options at spots like Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay during the tide window. Best: day after.
