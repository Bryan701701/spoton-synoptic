Today in Donegal, it's a bit of a bummer with flat conditions and no surf energy—just 0 ft @0s. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 6 ft @13s, but fresh ESE winds at 23 mph will make it messy and challenging. By the day after, we're looking at a solid 10 ft @9s, but again, strong SW winds at 27 mph will keep things blown out. Best: tomorrow.
