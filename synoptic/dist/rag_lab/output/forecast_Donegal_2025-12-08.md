Today in Donegal, conditions are poor with a hefty 6 ft @12s WSW swell, but fresh 21 mph SSW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell remains similar at 6 ft @13s, with winds picking up to 23 mph ESE, continuing the messy trend. By the day after, the swell increases to 10 ft @9s with strong 27 mph SW winds, keeping it challenging. Best: none.
