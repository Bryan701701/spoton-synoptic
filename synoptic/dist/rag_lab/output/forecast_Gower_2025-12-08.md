Today, Gower is seeing 6 ft @8s WSW with fresh 21 mph SW winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with 8 ft @9s WSW and strong 35 mph S winds, keeping it messy. The day after continues with 8 ft @10s WSW and 23 mph SW winds, still not producing clean surf. Best: none.
