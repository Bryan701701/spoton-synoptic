Today in County Sligo, it's looking great with 5 ft @9s N swell and light N winds at 11 mph. Dunmoran Strand and Easkey Right are both firing, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with a fresh N wind at 20 mph, making it blown out across the board. The day after, similar conditions persist with 4 ft @8s NNW swell and fresh SSW winds, keeping it poor. Best: today.
