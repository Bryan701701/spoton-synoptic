Today in County Sligo, it’s looking fun with 5 ft @9s N swell and a light 11 mph N wind. Good spots like Dunmoran Strand and Easkey Right are clean and working well throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 5 ft @8s N swell but fresh 20 mph N winds will make it blown out and poor across the board. Day after, the swell continues to drop to 4 ft @8s NNW with similar fresh winds, keeping it messy. Best: today.
