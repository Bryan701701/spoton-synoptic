Today in County Sligo, it's looking great with 5 ft @9s N swell and light 11 mph N winds. Dunmoran Strand and Easkey Right are prime spots, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 5 ft @8s N swell but fresh 20 mph N winds will make it blown out across the board. The day after, we see a further decline to 4 ft @8s NNW with 19 mph SSW winds, keeping things poor. Best: today.
