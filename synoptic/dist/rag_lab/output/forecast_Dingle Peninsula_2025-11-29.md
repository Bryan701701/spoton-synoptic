Today on the Dingle Peninsula, conditions are flat with no surf energy—just a calm day. Tomorrow looks much better with a swell of 5 ft @ 9s from the WNW and light 9 mph W winds, making for some clean surf at spots like Ballybunion. The day after, swell increases to 7 ft @ 8s WSW with moderate 14 mph S winds, offering some workable waves but expect a bit of chop. Best: tomorrow.
