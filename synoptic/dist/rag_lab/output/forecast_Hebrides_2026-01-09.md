Today in the Hebrides, surf is looking solid with 5 ft @ 10s W swell and light 6 mph SSE winds. Good spots like Europie and Barvas are working well, especially around mid-tide. Tomorrow, expect a bit more power with swell building to 6 ft @ 12s W and similar winds at 11 mph SSE, keeping conditions clean. Day after, winds ramp up to 28 mph SE, making it blown out and poor across the board. Best: tomorrow.
