Today in the Hebrides, surf is looking solid at 5 ft @ 10s W with light 6 mph SSE winds. Great options include Europie and Barvas, both working well throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell builds slightly to 6 ft @ 12s W, with similar winds, keeping the surf fun and consistent. Day after, expect a drop to 5 ft @ 6s SSW, but with fresh 28 mph SE winds, it’ll be blown out across the board. Best: tomorrow.
