County Clare is lighting up today with solid surf at 12 ft @15s W and light 4 mph SE winds. Best spots include Crab Island and Doolin Point, both offering great conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @12s WNW with moderate 8 mph N winds, still workable at spots like Lahinch Beach. Day after, it continues to ease to 2 ft @11s WNW with 10 mph NNE winds, but still fun at Cregg Beach. Best: today.
