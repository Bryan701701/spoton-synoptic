County Clare is lighting up today with solid 12 ft @ 15s W swell and light 4 mph SE winds. Best spots include Crab Island and Doolin Point, both offering great conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 12s WNW with moderate 8 mph N winds, still workable at Lahinch Beach and nearby. By the day after, expect smaller 2 ft @ 11s WNW, but still fun at spots like Cregg Beach. Best: today.
