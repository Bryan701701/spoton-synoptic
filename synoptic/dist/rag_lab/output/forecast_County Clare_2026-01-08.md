Today in County Clare, surf is looking fun with 3 ft @ 8s WNW across the board and light 4 mph NNW winds. Lahinch Beach and Cregg Beach are your best bets, both peaking from 08:48 to 16:40. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 5 ft @ 9s WNW with moderate 9 mph W winds, making for a lively session at spots like Doolin Point and Lahinch. Day after, expect 4 ft @ 10s WNW but fresh 23 mph WNW winds will likely chop it up. Best: tomorrow.
