Today on the East Coast, we have clean 2 ft @ 5s E swell with light 6 mph W winds. St Andrews West and Arbroath are your best bets, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 5 ft @ 8s E, but watch out for fresh 18 mph SSE winds making it a bit choppy. Day after, conditions drop to 4 ft @ 6s E with 19 mph S winds, likely making it blown out. Best: today.
