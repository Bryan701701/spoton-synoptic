Today in Caithness, it's a bit of a struggle with poor conditions: 2 ft @6s SSW and fresh 26 mph SSW winds. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 5 ft @10s WNW and lighter 14 mph SW winds, making it workable at spots like Point of Ness and Murkle Point during the mid-tide windows. Day after, conditions drop slightly to 4 ft @10s WNW with similar winds, still offering some fun at the same spots. Best: tomorrow.
