Today in Caithness, it's a bit of a struggle with 2 ft @6s SSW swell and fresh 26 mph SSW winds, making it blown out across the board—best to give it a miss. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 5 ft @10s WNW swell and lighter 14 mph SW winds, offering some workable options at spots like Point of Ness and Sandside Bay during the mid-tide windows. The day after sees a drop to 4 ft @10s WNW, still decent but with similar wind conditions. Best: tomorrow.
