Today in County Sligo, it’s looking good with 6 ft @11s WNW swell and light 6 mph S winds. Strandhill and Easkey spots are clean and fun, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @7s SW with fresh 24 mph S winds, making it a poor day for surf. The day after sees a slight increase to 5 ft @9s W, but with strong 27 mph SSW winds, it’ll be blown out. Best: today.
