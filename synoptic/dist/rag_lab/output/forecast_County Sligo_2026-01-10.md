Today in County Sligo, it’s looking solid with 6 ft @11s WNW swell and light 6 mph S winds. Strandhill and Easkey spots are clean and fun, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @7s SW with fresh 24 mph S winds, making it poor across the board. The day after, we see 5 ft @9s W swell but with stronger 27 mph SSW winds, keeping it messy. Best: today.
