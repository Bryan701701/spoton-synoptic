Today on the West Coast, it's a bit of a struggle with poor conditions—3 ft @11s W and fresh 19 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow looks much better as the swell picks up to 4 ft @11s W with lighter 10 mph SSW winds, offering some clean options at spots like Saligo Bay and Machir Bay. Day after, conditions drop back to 2 ft @8s W with fresh 25 mph SSW winds, making it less inviting. Best: tomorrow.
