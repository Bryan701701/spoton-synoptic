Today in North Devon, it’s looking pretty flat with 1 ft @ 7s NE swell and fresh 24 mph ENE winds. No good spots are working, so it’s a day to give it a miss. Tomorrow sees a slight bump to 2 ft @ 7s with lighter 12 mph ENE winds, but still not ideal. The day after drops back to 1 ft @ 12s W with light 3 mph S winds, keeping it quiet. Best: tomorrow.
