Today in the Hebrides, it's a no-go with 10 ft @10s SW swell and fresh 37 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight increase to 12 ft @15s WSW, but the strong S winds at 32 mph will keep conditions poor. The day after stays similar with 12 ft @13s WSW and 36 mph SSW winds, continuing the trend of challenging surf. Best: none.
