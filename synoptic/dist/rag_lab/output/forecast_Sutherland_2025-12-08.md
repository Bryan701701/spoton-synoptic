Today in Sutherland, it's a quiet scene with 4 ft @ 7s WSW swell but fresh 14 mph SW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 8s with 15 mph SE winds, still not producing much. By the day after, the swell picks up to 9 ft @ 8s, but strong 51 mph SW winds will make it challenging. Best: day after.
