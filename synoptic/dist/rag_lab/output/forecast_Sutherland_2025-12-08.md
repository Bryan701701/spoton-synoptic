Today in Sutherland, conditions are flat with no surf energy—just a calm day. Tomorrow, the swell picks up slightly to 2 ft @8s, but with fresh SE winds, it’ll be a bit choppy and not producing much. Day after, expect a significant jump to 9 ft @8s, but with strong SW winds at 51 mph, it’ll be blown out and challenging. Best: tomorrow.
