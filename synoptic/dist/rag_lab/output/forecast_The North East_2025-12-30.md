Today, the North East is lighting up with solid 5 ft @9s NNE swell and a moderate 12 mph NNE wind. Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach are prime spots, especially during daylight hours. Tomorrow, expect a slight drop to 4 ft @10s with fresh 18 mph W winds, still workable at sheltered corners like Saltburn Beach. On New Year's Day, conditions fade further to 3 ft @8s, with strong 25 mph WNW winds making it a poor choice. Best: today.
