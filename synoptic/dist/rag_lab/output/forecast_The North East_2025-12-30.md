Today in the North East, it's looking solid with 5 ft @9s NNE swell and a light 12 mph NNE wind. Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach are prime spots, especially during the daylight hours. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 4 ft @10s with a fresh 18 mph W wind, making it a bit choppy but still workable at sheltered corners like Saltburn. Day after, conditions decline further with 3 ft @8s NNW swell and a strong 25 mph WNW wind, likely making it blown out across the board. Best: today.
