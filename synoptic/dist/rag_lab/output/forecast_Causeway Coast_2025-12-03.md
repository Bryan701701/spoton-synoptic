Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking poor with 2 ft @10s WNW swell and fresh 19 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions drop further to 1 ft @9s WNW with 16 mph W winds, still not producing much. However, day after brings a solid improvement with 3 ft @12s WNW and lighter 11 mph SSE winds, making it a good day for some fun waves at spots like White Park Bay and Portballintrae. Best: day after.
