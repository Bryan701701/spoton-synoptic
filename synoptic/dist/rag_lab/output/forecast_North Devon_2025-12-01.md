Today in North Devon, it’s looking poor with 5 ft @7s SW swell and fresh 39 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 4 ft @8s W swell and lighter 13 mph S winds, offering some workable options at spots like Woolacombe and Croyde Beach. The day after, we see a further upgrade to 4 ft @11s WSW with light 8 mph SSE winds, making for a good surf day across the region. Best: day after.
