Today, the surf is flat across Cornwall with no swell hitting the coast. Tomorrow, conditions remain poor with only 3 ft @ 5s NNW at Bude, but wind from the NE at 16 mph may create some workable corners. The day after continues the trend with similar conditions, featuring 3 ft @ 5s NNW across most spots but with fresh onshore winds. Best: tomorrow.
