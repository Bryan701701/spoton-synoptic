Today, the South is seeing poor conditions with 3 ft @6s ESE swell, but fresh 23 mph ENE winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, similar 3 ft @5s E swell continues with 22 mph ENE winds, keeping it messy. The day after, swell increases slightly to 4 ft @6s ESE, but the wind remains at 22 mph E, still not ideal. Best: day after.
