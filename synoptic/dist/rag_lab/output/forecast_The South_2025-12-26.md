Today, the South is quiet with a 3 ft @6s ESE swell, but fresh 23 mph ENE winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with the same swell size and period, but the wind eases slightly to 22 mph, still not ideal. Day after, the swell picks up to 4 ft @6s ESE, but the wind stays fresh at 22 mph, keeping it messy. Best: day after.
