Today, Northwest Wales is seeing small, weak surf at 2 ft @ 4s WNW with fresh 13 mph WNW winds, making it a bit choppy. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 4 ft @ 6s NW, but the fresh 21 mph NW wind will keep it blown out. On the day after, conditions improve slightly with 2 ft @ 5s W, and a lighter 9 mph WNW wind, making for a better chance at some fun waves, especially around mid-morning. Best: day after.
