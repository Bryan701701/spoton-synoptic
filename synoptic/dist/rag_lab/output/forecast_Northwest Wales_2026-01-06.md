Today in Northwest Wales, it's a bit of a struggle with 2 ft @4s WNW and fresh 13 mph WNW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight increase to 4 ft @6s NW, but the fresh 21 mph NW winds will keep it messy. On the day after, conditions improve slightly with 2 ft @5s W and lighter 9 mph WNW winds, making Porth Oer a potential pick during the mid-morning tide. Best: day after.
