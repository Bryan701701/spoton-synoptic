Today in Northwest Wales, it's a bit of a struggle with 2 ft @4s WNW and fresh 13 mph WNW winds making for a blown-out scene. Tomorrow sees a slight increase to 4 ft @6s NW, but the 21 mph NW winds will keep things choppy and messy. Day after brings a drop back to 2 ft @5s W, with light 9 mph WNW winds; Porth Oer might offer a fun window on the push from 10:10 to 12:00. Best: day after.
