Today in the Hebrides, it's looking fun with 3 ft @ 11s NW swell and light SE winds. Tolsta and Port of Ness are your best bets, especially from 09:14 to 15:38 and 09:15 to 15:37 respectively. Tomorrow, the swell builds slightly to 4 ft @ 11s NW, with similar light ENE winds, keeping conditions clean at the same spots. By the day after, expect 4 ft @ 12s N swell with SSE winds, still offering great surf at Tolsta and Port of Ness. Best: tomorrow.
