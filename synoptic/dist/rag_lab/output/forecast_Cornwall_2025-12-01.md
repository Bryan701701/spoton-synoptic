Today, conditions are poor across Cornwall with fresh onshore winds blowing at 31 mph, creating blown-out surf at 7–8 ft. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 6 ft @10s with lighter winds at 13 mph SW, making it a workable day at spots like Fistral and Crantock. The day after, expect 8 ft @13s with moderate winds, still offering some options at Fistral and other North spots. Best: tomorrow.
