Today in Caithness, it's looking poor with 8 ft @8s SE swell and fresh 43 mph SSW winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow brings a slight improvement with 2 ft @8s ESE and 16 mph WSW winds; some sheltered spots like Point of Ness and Murkle Point may offer a workable session. The day after, expect 5 ft @9s WNW with lighter 13 mph WSW winds, providing better conditions at spots like The Cove and Sandside Bay. Best: day after.
