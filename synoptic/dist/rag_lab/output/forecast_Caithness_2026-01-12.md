Today in Caithness, it’s a tough call with poor conditions: 8 ft @8s SE swell and fresh 43 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 2 ft @8s ESE swell and moderate 16 mph WSW winds; a few sheltered spots like Point of Ness may offer some fun. The day after, conditions remain similar with 5 ft @9s WNW swell and lighter 13 mph WSW winds, providing better opportunities at spots like The Cove. Best: day after.
