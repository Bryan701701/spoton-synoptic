Today in Donegal, it's looking fun with 3 ft @10s WNW swell and light 6 mph E winds. Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are great picks, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, expect similar conditions with swell picking up to 3 ft @12s, and winds shifting slightly to 8 mph ESE. The day after continues the trend with 3 ft @12s WNW swell and light 5 mph NE winds, keeping it clean and enjoyable. Best: tomorrow.
