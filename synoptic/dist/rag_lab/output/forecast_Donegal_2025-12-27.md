Today in Donegal, expect fun surf at 3 ft @10s WNW with light E winds at 6 mph. Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are great picks, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 3 ft but picks up to 12s, with ESE winds at 8 mph, making for a clean day. On the day after, conditions remain similar, with 3 ft @12s WNW and light NE winds at 5 mph. Best: tomorrow.
