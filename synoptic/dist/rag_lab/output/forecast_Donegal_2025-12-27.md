Today in Donegal, we're seeing fun 3 ft @10s WNW swell with light E winds at 6 mph. Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are both clean and working well, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 3 ft @12s WNW swell and light ESE winds, making it a great day for a surf. The day after also holds solid 3 ft @12s WNW swell with light NE winds, keeping the surf lively. Best: tomorrow.
