Today in Pembrokeshire, conditions are challenging with a hefty 9 ft @10s SW swell and fresh 21 mph SW winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 5 ft @8s SW, but the wind remains fresh at 21 mph SSW, keeping it messy. Day after, things improve with 5 ft @12s WSW and light 6 mph WNW winds, offering cleaner waves at spots like Whitesands Bay and Freshwater West. Best: day after.
