Today on the Causeway Coast, it’s a bit of a struggle with 4 ft @11s NW swell and fresh 20 mph E winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 2 ft @10s WNW, but still not much to get excited about, especially with the same fresh E winds. By the day after, the swell picks up to 4 ft @13s WNW, and while it’s still a bit breezy at 14 mph E, White Park Bay and Portballintrae might offer some workable waves. Best: day after.
