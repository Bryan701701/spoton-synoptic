Today on the Causeway Coast, conditions are poor with 4 ft @11s NW swell and fresh 20 mph E winds. Tomorrow, things improve slightly with 2 ft @10s WNW, but still not ideal; Portballintrae may offer some fun. By the day after, we see 4 ft @13s WNW, with White Park Bay and Portballintrae being the best bets despite the fresh E winds. Best: day after.
