Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking fun with clean 2 ft @8s NNW swell and light 7 mph ENE winds. White Park Bay and Portballintrae are both firing, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions ease with 2 ft @10s NW swell and light 1 mph SSE winds, but only Portballintrae is showing promise. By the day after, expect flat conditions with 2 ft @7s NNE swell and fresh 10 mph ESE winds, making it a no-go. Best: today.
