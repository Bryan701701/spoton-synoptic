Today on the Causeway Coast, we have clean conditions with 2 ft @8s NNW swell and light 7 mph ENE winds. White Park Bay and Portballintrae are both looking good, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 2 ft but shifts to 10s NW with light winds, making Portballintrae the standout spot. By the day after, conditions drop with 2 ft @7s NNE and fresh ESE winds, leading to poor surf across the coast. Best: today.
