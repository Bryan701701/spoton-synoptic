Today in County Sligo, conditions are poor with 7 ft @9s NNW swell and fresh 21 mph NNW winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow brings a nice improvement with 5 ft @9s NW swell and light 1 mph SSE winds, making for clean surf at spots like Dunmoran Strand and Easkey. The day after, expect 4 ft @9s NW swell with light 7 mph SSW winds, still offering some fun waves at Strandhill and Easkey. Best: tomorrow.
