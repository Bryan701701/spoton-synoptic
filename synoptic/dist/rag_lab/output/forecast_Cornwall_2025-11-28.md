Today in Cornwall, North is lighting up with solid 8 ft @ 12s W swell and fresh 16 mph WSW winds. Fistral and Town are your best bets, especially during the early tides from 08:55 to 17:21. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 7 ft @ 11s W swell and fresh 35 mph SSW winds, making it a poor day across the board. By the day after, expect 5 ft @ 9s WNW swell with 19 mph WNW winds, still not ideal. Best: today.
