Today, the South coast has some workable options with Porthcurno and Praa Sands both showing 3ft @10s WSW. Winds are moderate at 16 mph NNW, making for a decent session during the early tides. Tomorrow, conditions drop slightly with 5ft @10s W on the North coast, but winds pick up to 18 mph S, keeping it messy. By the day after, the North lights up with 8ft @16s W, and winds ease to 17 mph SSE, offering a great opportunity. Best: day after.
