Today, the South coast has some workable options with Porthcurno and Praa Sands both offering 3ft @10s WSW. Winds are moderate at 16 mph NNW, making for decent conditions during the early tides. Tomorrow sees a drop in size to 3ft @8s WSW with fresh onshore winds, likely making it less appealing. By the day after, conditions improve with Fistral lighting up at 8ft @16s W and more favorable winds. Best: today.
