Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking solid with 5 ft @9s NW swell and light N winds at 13 mph. White Park Bay and Portballintrae are your best bets, both working well from 09:25 to 17:02. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @8s NW with fresh W winds at 17 mph, making it less appealing—Portballintrae still holds some potential. By the day after, conditions further decline to 1 ft @7s WNW with S winds, so it’s best to give it a miss. Best: today.
