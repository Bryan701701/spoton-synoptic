Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking solid with 5 ft @9s NW swell and light N winds at 13 mph. Good spots like White Park Bay and Portballintrae are working well, especially during the tide window from 09:25 to 17:02. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @8s NW with fresh W winds at 17 mph, making it less appealing, but Portballintrae might still have some rideable waves. By the day after, the conditions further decline to 1 ft @7s WNW, with S winds at 14 mph, so it’s best to take a break. Best: today.
