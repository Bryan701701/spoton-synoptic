County Clare is looking solid today with 4 ft @ 12s WNW swell and light 4 mph S winds. Doolin Point and Lahinch Beach are both clean and fun, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 6 ft @ 10s WSW and fresh 18 mph SSW winds, making it poor across the board. The day after, it ramps up to 11 ft @ 17s W, but the strong 21 mph SE winds will keep it blown out. Best: today.
