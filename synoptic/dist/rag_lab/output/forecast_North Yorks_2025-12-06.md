Today in North Yorks, it's a bit of a bummer with 2 ft @6s SE swell and fresh 19 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow drops to 1 ft @5s SSE with similar fresh winds, so not much happening. The day after sees a slight improvement to 2 ft @4s WNW, but still with onshore 10 mph SSW winds, keeping it messy. Best: day after.
