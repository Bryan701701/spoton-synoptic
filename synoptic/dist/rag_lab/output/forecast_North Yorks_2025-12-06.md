Today in North Yorks, it’s looking pretty quiet with 2 ft @6s SE swell and fresh 19 mph S wind. Tomorrow drops to 1 ft @5s SSE, still with that 19 mph WSW wind, so not much happening. The day after sees a slight bump back to 2 ft @4s WNW with lighter 10 mph SSW winds, but still not ideal. Best: today.
