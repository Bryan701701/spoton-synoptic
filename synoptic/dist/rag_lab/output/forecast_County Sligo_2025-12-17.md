Today in County Sligo, it's a bit rough with 4 ft @9s WSW swell and fresh 23 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, things improve with a solid 10 ft @17s WNW swell, but the same S winds will keep it messy, though some spots like Strandhill and Easkey Right might be workable. Day after, the swell holds at 10 ft @13s WNW, but with fresh 25 mph WSW winds, expect it to be quite choppy again. Best: tomorrow.
