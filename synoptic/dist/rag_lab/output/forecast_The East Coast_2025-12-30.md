Today on the East Coast, Aberdeen Harbour is lighting up with a fun 3ft @9s NE swell and light 8 mph NW winds. It's a great day to get out there, especially between 08:48 and 15:33. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2ft @10s NNE with fresh 17 mph WNW winds, making it a bit choppy but still workable at sheltered spots. Day after, conditions go poor with 3ft @5s NW and strong 22 mph winds, so best to sit this one out. Best: today.
