Today in Moray, it's a quiet scene with 2 ft @4s SW swell and fresh 21 mph SW winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees similar conditions with 2 ft @4s S swell and slightly lighter 13 mph SSE winds, still not producing much. By the day after, the swell drops to 1 ft @4s SSW, with 11 mph SSE winds, keeping it flat and uninviting. Best: tomorrow.
