Today in Moray, it's looking quite poor with 2 ft @4s SW swell and fresh 21 mph SW winds. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @4s S with lighter 13 mph SSE winds, but still not producing much. By the day after, it gets even smaller at 1 ft @4s SSW with 11 mph SSE winds, keeping things flat. Best: tomorrow.
