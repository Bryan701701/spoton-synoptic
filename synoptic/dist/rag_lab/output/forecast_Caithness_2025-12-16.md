Today in Caithness, it's a solid day with clean 7 ft @12s W swell and light 11 mph SSW winds. Best spots include Point of Ness and Murkle Point, both working well on the mid-tide push. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 5 ft @10s with fresh 30 mph S winds, making it less appealing. The day after, we see a return to 7 ft @15s with lighter winds, so keep an eye on those sheltered corners. Best: today.
