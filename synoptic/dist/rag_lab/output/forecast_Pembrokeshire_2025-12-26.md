Today in Pembrokeshire, it's looking pretty quiet with 2 ft @5s ESE lines and a fresh 7 mph NE wind. Tomorrow drops to 1 ft @6s SE, still with a fresh NE breeze, so not much happening. The day after sees a slight bump back to 2 ft @6s SE, but with a stronger 12 mph ENE wind, making it a bit choppy. Best: today.
