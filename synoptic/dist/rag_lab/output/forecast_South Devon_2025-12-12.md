South Devon is looking solid today with 5 ft @8s SSW swell and light 8 mph NW winds. Bovisand Reef, Challborough, and Bantham are all clean and working well, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @10s SW, with light 1 mph NE winds, making Bantham the best pick. Day after, conditions ease a bit with 4 ft @7s SW and fresh 13 mph SSW winds, still worth a look at Bantham. Best: today.
