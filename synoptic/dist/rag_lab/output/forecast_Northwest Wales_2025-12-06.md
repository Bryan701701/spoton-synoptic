Today in Northwest Wales, it's a bit of a washout with 7 ft @9s WSW swell and fresh 21 mph SW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow looks much better with 3 ft @10s WSW and light 6 mph ESE winds, perfect for a fun session at spots like Hells Mouth. The day after brings 4 ft @7s WSW with a moderate 14 mph SSW breeze; still workable at the right corners. Best: tomorrow.
