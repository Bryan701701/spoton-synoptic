Today, Gower is quiet with no surf action—wrong swell angle and fresh 27 mph onshore winds. Tomorrow, conditions improve significantly with 7 ft @13s WSW and light 5 mph W winds, making it a great day for spots like Llangennith Beach. The day after, surf remains decent at 6 ft @11s WSW, but winds pick up to 17 mph SW, so look for sheltered corners. Best: tomorrow.
