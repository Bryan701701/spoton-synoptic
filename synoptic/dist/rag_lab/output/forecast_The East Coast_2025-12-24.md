Today on the East Coast, it's looking solid with 4 ft @ 7s ESE swell and a moderate 13 mph S wind. Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay are your best bets, especially during the morning and early afternoon tides. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 6s ESE with light 4 mph W winds, making it a quieter day with only St Andrews West and Arbroath showing some potential. By the day after, conditions remain similar with 1 ft @ 6s SE swell and light winds, so it's best to keep expectations low. Best: today.
