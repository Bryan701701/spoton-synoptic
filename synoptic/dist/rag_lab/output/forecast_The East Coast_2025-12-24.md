Today on the East Coast, it's looking solid with 4 ft @ 7s ESE swell and a fresh 13 mph S wind. Good spots like Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay are working well, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 6s with light 4 mph W winds, making for a quieter day. By the day after, conditions remain similar with 1 ft @ 6s, but still some fun to be had at St Andrews West and Arbroath. Best: today.
