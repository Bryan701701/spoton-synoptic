The East Coast is lighting up today with 4 ft @ 7s ESE swell and fresh 13 mph S winds. Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay are your best bets, especially during the morning and midday tides. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 6s ESE with light 4 mph W winds, making for a quieter day, but St Andrews West and Arbroath could still offer some fun. Day after, it's 1 ft @ 6s SE with light 6 mph WNW winds, so expect smaller, more mellow conditions. Best: today.
