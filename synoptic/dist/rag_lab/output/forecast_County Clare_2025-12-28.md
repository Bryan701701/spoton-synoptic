Today in County Clare, it's a bit flat with 2 ft @11s WNW and fresh 13 mph ENE wind creating some onshore chop. Tomorrow drops to 1 ft @12s WNW, still with light 6 mph ENE winds, making it a quiet day. The day after, we see a slight bump back up to 2 ft @12s W, with 9 mph ENE winds, but still not much to write home about. Best: day after.
