Today in Pembrokeshire, conditions are poor with 3 ft @6s WNW swell and fresh 23 mph NW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, things improve significantly with 4 ft @7s WSW swell and light 8 mph W winds, creating clean conditions at spots like Whitesands Bay and Freshwater West. The day after, the swell increases to 6 ft @8s W, but fresh 22 mph NW winds will keep it messy across the coast. Best: tomorrow.
