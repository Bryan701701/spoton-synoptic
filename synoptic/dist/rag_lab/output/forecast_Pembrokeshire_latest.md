Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a solid day with 7 ft @ 9s WSW swell and light 9 mph SW winds. Great options at Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay, both working well throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @ 11s WSW, still clean with 7 mph winds, making it a fun day for all levels. On the day after, expect 6 ft @ 9s WSW with 12 mph W winds, slightly choppy but still rideable at the best spots. Best: today.
