Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a solid day with 7 ft @ 12s WSW swell and light 7 mph ESE winds. Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are both firing, perfect for catching some quality waves. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 10s, but still clean with the same light E winds; good for a fun session. By the day after, conditions ease further with 2 ft @ 7s SSW, but St Brides Bay and Tenby will still have some rideable waves. Best: today.
