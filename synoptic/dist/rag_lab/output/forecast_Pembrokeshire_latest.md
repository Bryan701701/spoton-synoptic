Today in Pembrokeshire, it's looking fun with 2 ft @9s WSW swell and light E winds. Spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are clean and working well, especially on the mid-tide push. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 2 ft @7s S swell and fresh E winds, making it poor across the board. By the day after, it's still on the smaller side at 1 ft @7s SSW, but St Brides Bay and Tenby may offer some rideable waves. Best: today.
