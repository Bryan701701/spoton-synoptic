Today in Pembrokeshire, it’s a solid day with 7 ft @ 12s WSW swell and light 7 mph ESE winds. Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are both firing, offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow sees a drop to 3 ft @ 10s WSW, still workable at the same spots with similar light winds. By the day after, conditions ease further to 2 ft @ 7s SSW, with only St Brides Bay and Tenby showing some potential. Best: today.
