Today in Pembrokeshire, surf is on with 4 ft @8s W and fresh 17 mph NW winds. Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are your go-to spots, offering clean conditions early and throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions improve with the same swell height but a lighter 9 mph N wind, making for fun, clean surf. Day after, expect 3 ft @5s S with strong 30 mph SSE winds, likely making it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
