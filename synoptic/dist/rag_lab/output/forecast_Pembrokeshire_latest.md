Today in Pembrokeshire, surf is looking solid at 5 ft @9s SW with fresh 16 mph SW winds. Sheltered corners like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are your best bets, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions take a turn with a hefty 12 ft @10s SW swell but strong 33 mph S winds will make it blown out. On the day after, the swell drops to 6 ft @10s SW with 19 mph SW winds, still not ideal. Best: today.
