Today in Pembrokeshire, surf is on at 3 ft @ 6s W with fresh 13 mph WNW winds. Good spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are working well, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @ 8s W but strong 23 mph NW winds will make it blown out across the board. Day after, we see a nice improvement with 5 ft @ 10s WSW and light 8 mph NW winds, making for clean surf at all the top spots. Best: day after.
