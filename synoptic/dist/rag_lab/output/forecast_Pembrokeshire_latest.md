Today, Pembrokeshire is quiet with a hefty 9 ft @10s SW swell but fresh 21 mph SW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a drop to 5 ft @8s SW, still messy with similar winds. Day after, conditions improve with 5 ft @12s WSW and light 6 mph WNW winds, making it a great day to hit the water. Best: day after.
