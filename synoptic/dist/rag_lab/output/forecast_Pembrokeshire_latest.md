Today in Pembrokeshire, it's looking solid with 5 ft @9s SW swell and fresh 16 mph SW winds. Good spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are working well, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions take a turn with a hefty 12 ft @10s SW swell and strong 33 mph S winds, making it blown out across the board. Day after, the swell drops to 6 ft @10s SW with 19 mph SW winds, still not ideal. Best: today.
