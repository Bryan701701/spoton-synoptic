Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a bit rough with 8 ft @10s SSW swell and fresh 30 mph SSW winds making for blown-out conditions. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 6 ft @10s with similar winds at 26 mph, still not ideal. The day after, the swell picks back up to 8 ft @9s but remains messy with 25 mph SSW winds. Best: none.
