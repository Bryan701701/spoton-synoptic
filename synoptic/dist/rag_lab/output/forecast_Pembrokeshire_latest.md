Today in Pembrokeshire, it's looking pretty quiet with 2 ft @7s SE lines and a fresh 11 mph NNE wind. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 2 ft @5s E swell and a moderate 15 mph NE wind, still not producing much. Day after drops further to 1 ft @5s ESE, keeping it flat and uninviting. Best: today.
