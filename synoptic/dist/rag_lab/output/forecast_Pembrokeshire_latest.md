Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a solid 7 ft @ 9s WSW with a light 9 mph SW wind. Good spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are firing, especially during the mid-tide push. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @ 11s, still fun but less powerful, and winds remain light. Day after, expect 6 ft @ 9s with a moderate 12 mph W wind, making it a bit choppy. Best: today.
