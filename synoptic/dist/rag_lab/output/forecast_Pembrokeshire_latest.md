Today in Pembrokeshire, surf is looking solid at 5 ft @9s WSW with fresh 17 mph SW winds. Best spots include Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay, both offering fun peaks throughout the day. Tomorrow, expect a slight drop to 4 ft @10s with winds easing to 15 mph S, still providing workable conditions. Day after, surf continues to decrease to 3 ft @9s, but with light 8 mph WNW winds, it should be clean and enjoyable. Best: today.
