Today in Pembrokeshire, conditions are poor with a fresh 31 mph SSE wind and 5 ft @ 6s SSW swell across all spots. Tomorrow remains similar, with the same swell size but a slightly longer period of 9s, still under fresh 19 mph SSW winds. On the day after, the surf improves to 4 ft @ 10s WSW with light 10 mph SE winds, making for a much cleaner session. Best: day after.
