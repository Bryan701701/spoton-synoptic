Today in Pembrokeshire, it's looking solid with 4 ft @ 11s WSW swell and a light 13 mph SSW wind. Good spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are clean and working well, especially on the mid-tide push. Tomorrow, conditions take a turn for the worse with 10 ft @ 11s WSW swell and fresh 21 mph WSW wind, making it blown out across the board. The day after, we see a drop to 5 ft @ 8s SW, but with strong 25 mph S winds, it remains poor. Best: today.
