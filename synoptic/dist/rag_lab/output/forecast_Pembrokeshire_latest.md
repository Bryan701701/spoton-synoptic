Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a bit of a bummer with all spots showing 6 ft @9s WSW but fresh 19 mph WSW wind making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with 5 ft @8s SW swell and a stronger 27 mph S wind, keeping it poor across the board. Day after, we see a nice shift with 5 ft @12s WSW swell and lighter 11 mph SSE winds, making for cleaner conditions at spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay. Best: day after.
