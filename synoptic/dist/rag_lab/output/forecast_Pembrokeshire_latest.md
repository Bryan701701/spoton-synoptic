Today in Pembrokeshire, it's looking great with 5 ft @10s WSW swell and light 8 mph NW winds. Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are prime spots, delivering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @6s SSW with fresh 30 mph SSE winds, making it blown out and not workable. The day after, swell picks up to 6 ft @9s SW but remains messy with 26 mph SSW winds. Best: today.
