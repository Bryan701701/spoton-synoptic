Today in Pembrokeshire, conditions are poor with 5 ft @9s SW swell and fresh 30 mph SSW winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, things improve significantly with 5 ft @13s WSW swell and light 8 mph WSW winds, offering clean and workable waves at spots like Whitesands Bay and Freshwater West. The day after, surf remains consistent at 5 ft @10s WSW with moderate 13 mph SW winds, still providing fun options. Best: tomorrow.
