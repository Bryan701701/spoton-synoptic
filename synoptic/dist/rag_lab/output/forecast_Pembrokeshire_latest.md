Today in Pembrokeshire, it’s looking poor with 5 ft @11s WSW swell and fresh 20 mph WSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve significantly with 5 ft @9s WSW swell and light 8 mph W winds, offering clean surf at spots like Whitesands Bay. Day after, the swell drops slightly to 4 ft @9s WSW, still clean with 11 mph S winds, making it a fun day for all levels. Best: tomorrow.
