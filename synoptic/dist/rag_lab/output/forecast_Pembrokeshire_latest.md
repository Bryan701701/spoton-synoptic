Today in Pembrokeshire, the surf is looking solid with 5 ft @10s WSW swell and light 8 mph NW winds. Great options include Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay, both offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 4 ft @6s SSW swell and fresh 30 mph SSE winds, making it poor for surfing.
