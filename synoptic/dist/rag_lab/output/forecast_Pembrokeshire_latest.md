Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a no-go with fresh WSW winds at 25 mph, creating blown-out conditions and 13 ft @ 12s swell. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 5 ft @ 11s WSW swell and ESE winds at 14 mph, making for some workable corners like Whitesands Bay. The day after, swell picks up to 8 ft @ 9s SW, still with ESE winds, offering a better chance for fun waves. Best: tomorrow.
