Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a quiet scene with 2 ft @5s E swell, but fresh 13 mph NE winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow stays similar with 2 ft @5s E swell and slightly lighter 10 mph ENE winds, still not producing much. By the day after, the swell drops to 1 ft @6s ESE, with 12 mph ENE winds continuing to keep things flat. Best: tomorrow.
