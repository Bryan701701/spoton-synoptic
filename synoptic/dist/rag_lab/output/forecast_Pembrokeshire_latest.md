Today in Pembrokeshire, it's looking great with 3 ft @ 11s WSW swell and light NNW winds at 10 mph. Spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are clean and fun, especially on the mid-tide push. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 4 ft @ 8s SW swell and fresh SSW winds at 29 mph, making it blown out and poor across the board. Day after, surf picks up to 5 ft @ 11s WSW but with moderate S winds at 16 mph; still workable at the best spots. Best: today.
