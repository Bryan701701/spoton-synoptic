Today in Pembrokeshire, it's looking solid with 6 ft @12s WSW swell and light 7 mph SSW winds. Great options at Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay, both providing clean conditions. Tomorrow, conditions deteriorate with 7 ft @8s SW swell and fresh 29 mph SSW winds, making it blown out across the board. Day after, still rough with 5 ft @9s SW swell and 24 mph S winds, so best to hold off. Best: today.
