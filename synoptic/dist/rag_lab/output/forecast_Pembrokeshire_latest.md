Today in Pembrokeshire, it's looking poor with 8 ft @10s SSW swell but fresh 30 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 6 ft @10s SW, but the wind remains fresh at 26 mph, keeping conditions messy. On the day after, expect similar conditions with 8 ft @9s SW swell and 25 mph SSW winds, still not ideal. Best: none.
