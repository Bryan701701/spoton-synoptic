Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a bit of a bummer with 2 ft @5s WNW swell and fresh 16 mph WNW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight increase to 3 ft @5s WNW, but the fresh 19 mph NW winds will keep it messy. The day after also holds 3 ft @5s NW with 18 mph NNW winds, so expect similar conditions. Best: today.
