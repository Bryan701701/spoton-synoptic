Today in Pembrokeshire, it's looking solid with 6 ft @11s WSW swell and fresh 17 mph SSE winds. Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are your best bets, offering clean conditions on the mid-tide push. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 6 ft @9s SW swell and fresh 21 mph SW winds, making it poor across the board. Day after, the swell picks up to 11 ft @11s SW but strong 37 mph S winds will make it blown out. Best: today.
