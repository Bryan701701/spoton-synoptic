Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a quiet scene with 1 ft @ 5s WNW across the board and a fresh 9 mph WNW wind. Tomorrow, the swell picks up slightly to 3 ft @ 6s WNW, but with a strong 23 mph NW wind, conditions will be blown out. By the day after, we're looking at a much better setup with 2 ft @ 6s WSW and light 5 mph WNW winds, making for clean surf at spots like Whitesands Bay. Best: day after.
