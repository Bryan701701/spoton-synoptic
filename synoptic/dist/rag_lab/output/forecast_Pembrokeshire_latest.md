Today in Pembrokeshire, conditions are poor with a fresh 31 mph SSE wind and 5 ft @6s SSW swell across all spots. Tomorrow, the swell remains at 5 ft but with a slightly longer period of 9s, though the wind stays fresh at 19 mph SSW, keeping it messy. Day after, the surf improves to 4 ft @10s WSW with light 10 mph SE winds, making for cleaner conditions at spots like Whitesands Bay and Abereiddy. Best: day after.
