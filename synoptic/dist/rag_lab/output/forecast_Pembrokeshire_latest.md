Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a solid 7 ft @ 9s WSW with a light 9 mph SW wind. Great options at Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay, both offering clean conditions. Tomorrow sees a drop to 4 ft @ 11s, still fun but a bit softer, with similar winds. Day after brings 6 ft @ 9s, with a moderate 12 mph W wind, making it a bit choppy. Best: today.
