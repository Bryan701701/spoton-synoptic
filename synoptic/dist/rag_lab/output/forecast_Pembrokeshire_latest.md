Today in Pembrokeshire, it’s a quiet one with 1 ft @ 7s NE swell across the board and fresh 9 mph NE winds. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 1 ft @ 11s WSW swell; St Brides Bay and Tenby may offer some fun, especially on the mid-tide push. Day after, the swell picks up to 2 ft @ 5s WNW but with fresh onshore winds, making it less than ideal. Best: tomorrow.
