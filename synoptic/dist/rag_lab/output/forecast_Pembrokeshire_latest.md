Today in Pembrokeshire, it's looking solid with 6 ft @9s WSW swell and light 9 mph SSW winds. Great options at Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay, both offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, expect a hefty 10 ft @12s WSW swell with fresh 30 mph WSW winds, making it blown out and poor across the board. On the day after, conditions improve with 5 ft @11s WSW swell and lighter 10 mph SE winds, making for a fun surf day at spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay. Best: today.
