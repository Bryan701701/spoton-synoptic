Today in Pembrokeshire, conditions are poor with 5 ft @9s SW swell and fresh 30 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, things improve significantly with 5 ft @13s WSW swell and light 8 mph WSW winds, offering clean surf at spots like Whitesands Bay and Freshwater West. The day after, surf remains at 5 ft but with a shorter 10s period and moderate 13 mph SW winds, still providing workable waves. Best: tomorrow.
