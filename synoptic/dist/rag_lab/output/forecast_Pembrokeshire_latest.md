Today in Pembrokeshire, it’s looking great with 3 ft @ 11s WSW swell and light 10 mph NNW winds. Spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are clean and fun, especially on the mid-tide push. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @ 8s SW with fresh 29 mph SSW winds, making it poor across the board. On the day after, we see a slight improvement with 5 ft @ 11s WSW and 16 mph S winds, still workable at spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay. Best: today.
