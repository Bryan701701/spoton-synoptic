Today in Pembrokeshire, it’s looking solid with 4 ft @ 9s SW swell and light 6 mph N winds. Great conditions at spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay, especially on the mid-tide push. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 4 ft but shifts to a longer 12s period, still with light winds, making it another fun day across the coast. By the day after, expect fresh 28 mph SSW winds, which will blow out the surf, making it a day to skip. Best: tomorrow.
