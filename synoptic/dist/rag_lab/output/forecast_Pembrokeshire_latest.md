Today in Pembrokeshire, it’s a solid 3 ft @ 11s WSW with light 10 mph NNW winds, making for clean conditions at spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay. Tomorrow, conditions drop as winds pick up to 29 mph SSW, creating blown-out surf at 4 ft @ 8s across the board. Day after, the swell builds to 5 ft @ 11s WSW, but with 16 mph S winds, it’s workable at sheltered spots like Freshwater West and Marloes Sands. Best: today.
