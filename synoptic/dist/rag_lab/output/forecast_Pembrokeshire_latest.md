Today in Pembrokeshire, the surf is poor with 6 ft @8s SW swell and fresh 23 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 5 ft @12s WSW swell and moderate 15 mph SSW winds, offering some workable conditions at spots like Whitesands Bay. The day after, conditions drop back to 6 ft @10s WSW with fresh 19 mph WSW winds, keeping the surf messy. Best: tomorrow.
