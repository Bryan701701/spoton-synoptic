Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a quiet day with 1 ft @ 7s NE swell and fresh 9 mph NE wind; not much happening. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 1 ft @ 11s WSW swell, but still only St Brides Bay and Tenby showing some potential with light 6 mph ENE winds. The day after, conditions drop to 2 ft @ 5s WNW with fresh 11 mph WNW winds, likely making it blown out across the board. Best: tomorrow.
