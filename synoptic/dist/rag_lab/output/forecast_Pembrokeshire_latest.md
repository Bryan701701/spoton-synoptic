Today in Pembrokeshire, it’s a solid day with 6 ft @9s WSW swell and light 9 mph SSW winds. Spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are clean and working well throughout the day. Tomorrow, expect a big jump to 10 ft @12s WSW but with fresh 30 mph WSW winds, making it blown out and poor conditions. On the day after, the swell drops to 5 ft @11s WSW with a light 10 mph SE breeze, offering a much cleaner surf experience at places like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay. Best: today.
