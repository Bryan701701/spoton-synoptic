Today in Pembrokeshire, conditions are poor with 3 ft @5s NW swell but fresh 15 mph NW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell remains the same at 3 ft @5s NW, but winds pick up to 21 mph NNW, keeping it messy. The day after, the swell drops slightly to 2 ft @6s WNW with 17 mph NNW winds, still not ideal. Best: none.
