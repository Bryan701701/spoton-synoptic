Today in Pembrokeshire, surf is small and not producing, with 2 ft @6s SE lines and fresh 7 mph NE winds. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 2 ft @7s SE, still not ideal. Day after brings a slight improvement with 2 ft @10s WSW, but only a couple of spots like St Brides Bay and Tenby show potential. Best: day after.
