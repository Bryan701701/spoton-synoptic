Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a quiet one with 1 ft @ 5s WNW across the board and fresh 9 mph WNW winds. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 3 ft @ 6s WNW, but with fresh 23 mph NW winds, it will be blown out. The day after brings a nice improvement with 2 ft @ 6s WSW and light 5 mph WNW winds, making for clean conditions at spots like Whitesands Bay. Best: day after.
