Today in South Devon, Bantham is the standout with 5 ft @9s W and a fresh 16 mph NW wind. Expect some clean conditions early, but it may get a bit choppy later. Tomorrow sees a drop to 3 ft @8s WSW across the board with fresh 21 mph NW winds, making it less inviting. By the day after, conditions worsen further with 2 ft @5s SSW and stronger 27 mph S winds, so it’s best to enjoy today while it lasts! Best: today.
