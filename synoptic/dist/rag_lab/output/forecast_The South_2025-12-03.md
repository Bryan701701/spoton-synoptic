Today, the South is seeing some fun 2 ft @8s SSW swell with fresh 13 mph SW winds. Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane are your best bets, especially from 09:28 to 17:32. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 4 ft @8s SW, with moderate 18 mph W winds, making for a lively day at spots like Ballinskelligs Bay and Barley Cove. Day after, conditions drop to 5 ft @6s SSW with strong 32 mph SSE winds, likely making it blown out and poor. Best: tomorrow.
