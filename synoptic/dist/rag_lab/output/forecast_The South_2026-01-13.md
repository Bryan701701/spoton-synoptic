Today in The South, conditions are poor with 3 ft @8s SSW swell and fresh 19 mph NNW wind, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 2 ft @9s SSW, still with fresh 19 mph SSW winds, keeping it messy. Day after, we finally catch a break with 4 ft @7s SSW and light 5 mph N winds, creating clean conditions at spots like Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane. Best: day after.
