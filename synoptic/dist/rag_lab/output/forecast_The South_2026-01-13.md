Today, the South is quiet with a weak 3 ft @8s SSW swell, but fresh 19 mph NNW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 2 ft @9s SSW, with similar fresh winds continuing to chop things up. On the bright side, day after brings a solid 4 ft @7s SSW swell, with light 5 mph N winds creating clean conditions at spots like Ballinskelligs Bay. Best: day after.
