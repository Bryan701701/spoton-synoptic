Today in North Yorks, surf is looking fun with 3 ft @5s E and fresh 17 mph ENE winds. Withernsea and Filey are your best bets, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions ease a bit with 2 ft @4s ENE, still workable for beginners but not as lively. By the day after, we see a nice bump back up to 3 ft @7s NE with light 8 mph NE winds, making it a great day to hit the water! Best: day after.
