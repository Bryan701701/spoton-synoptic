Today in North Yorks, there's some fun surf with 3 ft @ 5s E and fresh 17 mph ENE winds. Good spots like Withernsea and Filey are working well, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, expect a slight drop to 2 ft @ 4s ENE, still manageable but not as lively, with winds easing a bit. By the day after, conditions improve with 3 ft @ 7s NE and light 8 mph NE winds, making it a great day for a session. Best: day after.
