Today on the East Coast, St Andrews West and Arbroath are both clean and fun at 2 ft @ 6s ESE with light 4 mph W winds. Best times are from 08:45 to 15:37 for St Andrews and early for Arbroath. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 1 ft @ 6s SE with light 6 mph NW winds, still workable but less exciting. The day after, similar 1 ft @ 4s ENE conditions persist, with a bit more wind at 9 mph NW. Best: today.
