Today in County Sligo, surf is looking great with 5 ft @10s NNW swell and light 5 mph SW winds. Dunmoran Strand and Easkey Right are prime spots, especially with the tides favoring Dunmoran from 08:49 to 16:38. Tomorrow, conditions drop as fresh 24 mph S winds blow through, making it poor across the board. On the day after, we see a slight improvement with 5 ft @12s WNW swell, but S winds at 13 mph will keep things mixed. Best: today.
