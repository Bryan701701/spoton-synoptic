Today in County Sligo, it's looking great with 5 ft @10s NNW swell and light 5 mph SW winds. Dunmoran Strand and Easkey Right are your top picks, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop as fresh 24 mph S winds blow through, making it poor across all spots. On the day after, we see a slight improvement with 5 ft @12s WNW swell, but still a mixed bag with Strandhill and Easkey Right being the best options. Best: today.
