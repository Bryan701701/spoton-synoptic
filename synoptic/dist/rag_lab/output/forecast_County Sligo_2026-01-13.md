Today in County Sligo, it’s a solid day with 5 ft @10s NNW swell and light 5 mph SW winds. Dunmoran Strand and Easkey Right are your top picks, with the best conditions at Dunmoran from 08:49 to 16:38. Tomorrow, expect poor conditions as fresh 24 mph S winds will chop up the swell across all spots. Day after, conditions improve slightly with 5 ft @12s WNW swell, but still a bit messy due to 13 mph S winds. Best: today.
