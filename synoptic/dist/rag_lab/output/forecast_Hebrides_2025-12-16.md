Today in the Hebrides, it's a no-go with 9 ft @12s WSW swell and fresh 27 mph SW winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with 11 ft @9s SW swell and strong 45 mph S winds, keeping it messy across the board. Day after, the swell ramps up to 15 ft @15s WSW with 34 mph SW winds, still not workable. Best: none.
