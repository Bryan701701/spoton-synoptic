Today in North Yorks, it's looking great with 4 ft @9s NNE swell and light 8 mph W winds. Withernsea and Filey are prime spots, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop as the swell weakens and winds pick up to 21 mph WNW, making it poor across the board. The day after, expect 9 ft @10s N swell with strong 35 mph NW winds, so it’ll be blown out. Best: today.
