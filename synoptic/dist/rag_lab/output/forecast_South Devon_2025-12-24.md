Today in South Devon, it's a bit of a struggle with 3 ft @5s E swell and fresh 15 mph ENE winds creating a messy scene. Tomorrow sees a bump to 5 ft @7s E, but the strong 35 mph NE winds will make it challenging. By the day after, conditions drop back to 3 ft @5s ESE with light 10 mph E winds, but still not producing much. Best: today.
