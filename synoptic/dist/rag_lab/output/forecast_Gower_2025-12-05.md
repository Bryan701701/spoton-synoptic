Today in Gower, it's looking fun with 4ft @9s WSW swell and a fresh 14 mph SW wind. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are your best bets, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell ramps up to 13ft @11s WSW with strong 28 mph WSW winds, making it poor for surfing. However, the day after brings a solid 6ft @12s WSW swell with light 10 mph ESE winds, perfect for catching some clean waves at spots like Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach. Best: today.
