Today, Gower is looking solid with 4ft @9s WSW swell and fresh 14 mph SW winds. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are both working well, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions shift as the swell jumps to 13ft @11s WSW with strong 28 mph WSW winds, making it poor across the board. On the day after, expect a nice rebound with 6ft @12s WSW swell and light 10 mph ESE winds, perfect for a fun session at spots like Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach. Best: day after.
