Today, Gower is looking solid with 4ft @9s WSW swell and fresh 14 mph SW winds. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are your best bets, especially during the tides. Tomorrow, conditions take a turn with 13ft @11s WSW swell and fresh 28 mph WSW winds, making it poor across the board. Day after, we see a nice recovery with 6ft @12s WSW swell and light 10 mph ESE winds, perfect for a fun surf day at spots like Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach. Best: day after.
