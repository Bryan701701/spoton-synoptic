Today in Gower, it's a bit of a struggle with 1 ft @ 6s W and fresh 14 mph NNW winds making for blown-out conditions. Tomorrow sees similar 1 ft @ 5s WNW with lighter 8 mph NNW winds, but still not producing. Day after, we keep the same small swell at 1 ft @ 5s WNW, with moderate 13 mph NW winds. Best: tomorrow.
