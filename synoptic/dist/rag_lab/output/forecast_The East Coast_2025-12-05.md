Today on the East Coast, it's a flat day with no surf action, as the swell isn’t hitting this coast. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with a fresh SE wind at 30 mph and a swell of 7 ft @ 8s, making it blown out and unworkable. The day after brings a nice change, with 3 ft @ 7s ESE and light winds at 3 mph, creating clean, fun conditions at spots like Coldinham Bay. Best: day after.
