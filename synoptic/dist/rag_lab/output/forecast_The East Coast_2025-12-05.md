Today on the East Coast, it’s a flat day with no surf action—wrong swell angle and wind on it. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with a fresh 30 mph SE wind and a swell of 7 ft @ 8s, making it blown out and messy. The day after brings a nice change with clean 3 ft @ 7s ESE lines and light 3 mph W winds, perfect for a fun session at spots like Coldinham Bay. Best: day after.
