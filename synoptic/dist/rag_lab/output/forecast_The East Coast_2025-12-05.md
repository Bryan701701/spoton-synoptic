Today on the East Coast, conditions are flat with no surf energy—just a calm day. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 7 ft @ 8s but with fresh 30 mph SE winds, making it blown out and messy. The day after brings a welcome change with 3 ft @ 7s ESE swell and light 3 mph W winds, creating clean and workable conditions at spots like Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay. Best: day after.
