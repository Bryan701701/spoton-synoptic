Today on the East Coast, it's a quiet day with no surf action—swell isn't hitting this coast. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with a fresh 30 mph SE wind and a building swell at 7 ft @8s, but it's likely to be blown out. The day after brings a welcome change with cleaner 3 ft @7s ESE lines and light 3 mph W winds, making it a fun day at spots like Coldinham Bay. Best: day after.
