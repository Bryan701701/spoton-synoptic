Today in County Sligo, it's looking great with 5 ft @9s NW swell and light 4 mph SSE winds. Dunmoran Strand and Easkey Right are prime spots, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop slightly to 4 ft @9s NW with fresh 16 mph WSW winds, making it a bit choppy, but Easkey spots still have potential. On the day after, expect 5 ft @11s WNW swell with 12 mph SW winds, bringing cleaner conditions back to Strandhill and Easkey. Best: today.
