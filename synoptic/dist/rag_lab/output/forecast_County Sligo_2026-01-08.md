Today in County Sligo, it's a solid day with 5 ft @9s NW swell and light 4 mph SSE winds. Dunmoran Strand and Easkey Right are your best bets, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 4 ft @9s NW with fresh 16 mph WSW winds, making it a bit choppy, but Easkey spots might still offer some fun. Day after, conditions improve again with 5 ft @11s WNW swell and moderate 12 mph SW winds, perfect for Strandhill and Easkey. Best: today.
