Today in North Devon, conditions are on the quieter side with 2 ft @ 5s NW swell and fresh 9 mph NNE winds. Tomorrow, the same swell persists but with slightly stronger 14 mph N winds, keeping it less than ideal. Day after, we see a shift with 2 ft @ 5s NW swell and lighter 6 mph NNW winds, making for a more enjoyable surf day at spots like Woolacombe and Putsborough. Best: day after.
