Today in North Devon, it's looking pretty quiet with 2 ft @5s NW swell and fresh 9 mph NNE wind. Tomorrow stays similar with the same swell size and angle, but wind picks up to 14 mph N, making it a bit choppy. Day after brings a nice change with 2 ft @5s NW swell and light 6 mph NNW winds, creating clean conditions at spots like Woolacombe and Putsborough. Best: day after.
