Today in Gower, conditions are poor with 4 ft @6s SW swell and fresh 27 mph SSE winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees an increase to 8 ft @9s WSW, but with 19 mph SSW winds, it remains messy. The day after brings cleaner 5 ft @10s WSW with light 12 mph SE winds, providing a much better surf opportunity. Best: day after.
