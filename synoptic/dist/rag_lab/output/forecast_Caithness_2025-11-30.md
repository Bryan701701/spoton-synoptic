Today in Caithness, it's looking solid with 6 ft @9s N swell and moderate 12 mph N winds. Point of Ness and Murkle Point are both working well, especially from 11:01 to 16:27. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @9s NE with fresh 27 mph SSE winds, making it a poor day for surf. Day after brings back the fun with 6 ft @13s WNW swell and light 9 mph S winds, perfect for a session at spots like Point of Ness and Murkle Point. Best: day after.
