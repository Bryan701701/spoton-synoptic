Today in North Yorks, it’s a bit of a struggle with 3 ft @6s SSE and fresh 21 mph SSW winds creating a blown-out scene. Tomorrow drops to 1 ft @3s SSE with 16 mph SSW winds, so it’s looking quiet. The day after sees a slight improvement with 2 ft @5s NW and lighter 15 mph W winds, but still not great. Best: day after.
