Today in North Yorks, it’s a bit of a struggle with 3 ft @6s SSE and fresh 21 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow drops to 1 ft @3s SSE, still messy with 16 mph SSW winds—definitely a day to skip. The day after sees a slight improvement to 2 ft @5s NW, but with a moderate 15 mph W wind, conditions remain poor. Best: day after.
