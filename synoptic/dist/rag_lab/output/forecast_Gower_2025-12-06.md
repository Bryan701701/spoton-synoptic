Today, Gower is quiet with no surf, as the swell isn't hitting this coast and the wind is fresh onshore at 35 mph. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 5 ft @11s WSW swell, but the fresh ESE wind at 21 mph will keep it messy. By the day after, we see a better setup with 6 ft @8s SW swell and lighter winds at 17 mph, making it workable at spots like Llangennith Beach and Broughton Bay. Best: day after.
