Today, Gower is quiet with no surf, as the swell isn't hitting this coast and the wind is fresh onshore at 35 mph. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 5 ft @11s WSW, but the fresh ESE wind at 21 mph will keep it messy. By the day after, conditions get better with 6 ft @8s SW and lighter winds, making it workable at spots like Llangennith Beach. Best: day after.
