Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it's a no-go with poor conditions: 11 ft @12s W swell met by fresh 32 mph SSW winds. Tomorrow, similar story with 11 ft @10s WSW swell and 34 mph SSW winds, keeping it blown out. On the day after, conditions improve slightly with 9 ft @11s W swell and lighter 14 mph W winds, making it workable at spots like Ballybunion Left and Garywilliam Point. Best: day after.
