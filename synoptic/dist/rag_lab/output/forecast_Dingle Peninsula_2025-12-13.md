Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it's looking poor with 11 ft @12s W swell but fresh 32 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow stays similar, with 11 ft @10s WSW swell and fresh 34 mph SSW winds continuing the chop. On the day after, conditions improve slightly with 9 ft @11s W swell and lighter 14 mph W winds, offering some workable options at spots like Ballybunion Left and Garywilliam Point. Best: day after.
