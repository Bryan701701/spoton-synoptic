Today on the Dingle Peninsula, conditions are poor with a hefty 11 ft @12s W swell, but fresh 32 mph SSW winds are blowing it out. Tomorrow, the swell remains similar at 11 ft @10s WSW, with winds picking up to 34 mph SSW, keeping it messy. By the day after, things improve slightly with 9 ft @11s W swell and lighter 14 mph W winds, making it more workable at spots like Ballybunion Left and Garywilliam Point. Best: day after.
