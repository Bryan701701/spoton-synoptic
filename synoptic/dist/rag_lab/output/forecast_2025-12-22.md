Today, the West Coast is feeling the effects of fresh 23 mph E winds, leaving the 5 ft @11s WNW swell blown out across all spots. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @10s with lighter 12 mph ENE winds, still not producing much. By the day after, conditions improve slightly with 5 ft @13s WNW swell and moderate 13 mph E winds, offering some workable options at spots like Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay. Best: day after.
