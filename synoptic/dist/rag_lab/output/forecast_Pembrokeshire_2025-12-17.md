Today in Pembrokeshire, it’s a bit rough with 6 ft @8s SW swell and fresh 23 mph SSW winds. All spots are blown out, so it’s best to give it a miss. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 5 ft @12s WSW swell and moderate 15 mph SSW winds, making for some workable conditions at places like Whitesands Bay. The day after, conditions drop back to 6 ft @10s WSW with similar winds, remaining poor across the board. Best: tomorrow.
