Today, the South is quiet with 4 ft @6s SSW swell, but fresh 25 mph onshore winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 9 ft @11s SW, but the same fresh winds will keep conditions messy. By the day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @8s SSW with lighter 15 mph winds, making it more workable. Best: day after.
