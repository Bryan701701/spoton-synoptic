Today, the South is quiet with 4 ft @6s SSW swell but fresh 25 mph S wind making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 9 ft @11s SW, but the same strong wind continues to create messy conditions. By the day after, conditions improve slightly with 3 ft @8s SSW and lighter 15 mph S wind, making it more workable. Best: day after.
