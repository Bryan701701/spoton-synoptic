Today, the South is quiet with a 4 ft @6s SSW swell, but fresh 25 mph onshore winds are blowing it out. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 9 ft @11s SW, yet the same strong winds will keep conditions poor. By the day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @8s SSW with lighter 15 mph winds, making it more workable at spots like Ballinskelligs Bay. Best: day after.
