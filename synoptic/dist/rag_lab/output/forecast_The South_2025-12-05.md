Today, the South is seeing poor conditions with 4 ft @6s SSW swell and fresh 25 mph S winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, the swell increases to 9 ft @11s SW, but the fresh 25 mph W wind continues to chop it up, keeping it messy. By the day after, conditions improve slightly with 3 ft @8s SSW and lighter 15 mph S winds, making it more workable at sheltered spots. Best: day after.
