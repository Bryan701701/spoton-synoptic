Today, the North East is lighting up with 3 ft @ 5s E swell and fresh 18 mph ENE winds. Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands are both working well, especially during their prime tides. Tomorrow, conditions ease to 2 ft @ 5s E with lighter 10 mph ENE winds, making it a fun day for all levels. The day after, expect 2 ft @ 4s ENE with fresh winds, but it may be a bit blown out. Best: today.
