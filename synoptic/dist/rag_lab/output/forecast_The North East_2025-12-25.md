Today in the North East, it's looking fun with 3 ft @ 5s E swell and fresh 18 mph ENE winds. Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands are your best bets, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 5s E with lighter 10 mph ENE winds, still offering some clean options at spots like Saltburn and Hartlepool. On the day after, conditions decline with 2 ft @ 4s ENE swell and fresh 19 mph NNE winds, making it a bit blown out. Best: today.
