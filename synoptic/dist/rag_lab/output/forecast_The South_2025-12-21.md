The South is lighting up today with 5 ft @10s SSW swell and a moderate 13 mph SE wind. Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane are prime spots, offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @6s SE with light 8 mph N winds, making Strand the only workable option. Day after, conditions worsen with 3 ft @6s SE and fresh 14 mph ENE winds, leaving most spots blown out. Best: today.
