Today in The South, it's looking solid with 5 ft @10s SSW swell and a light 13 mph SE wind. Spots like Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane are working well, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, the surf drops to 2 ft @6s SE with a light 8 mph N wind, making it a bit lackluster, but Strand might still offer some fun. Day after, conditions worsen with 3 ft @6s SE and fresh 14 mph ENE winds, leading to blown-out surf. Best: today.
