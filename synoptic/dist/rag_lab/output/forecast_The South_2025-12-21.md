Today, the South is lighting up with a solid 5 ft @10s SSW swell and a moderate 13 mph SE wind. Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane are prime spots, offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @6s SE with light 8 mph N winds, making it a bit lackluster but still workable at Strand. Day after, the swell picks up slightly to 3 ft @6s SE, but fresh 14 mph ENE winds will chop it up. Best: today.
