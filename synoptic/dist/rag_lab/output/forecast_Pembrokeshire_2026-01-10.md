Today in Pembrokeshire, it’s a solid day with 5 ft @10s WSW swell and light 8 mph NW winds. Spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are clean and working well, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 4 ft @6s SSW swell and fresh 30 mph SSE winds, making it blown out across the board. The day after sees a similar trend with 6 ft @9s SW swell and 26 mph SSW winds, still not ideal. Best: today.
