Today in Cornwall, Bude is your go-to with clean 2ft @5s NW and light 9 mph NNW winds, best enjoyed on the early tide from 08:19 to 16:28. Sennen Cove offers some fun with 3ft @6s NNW, though the fresh 14 mph NNW wind might add some texture; best early from 08:21 to 16:36. Tomorrow, conditions drop with poor surf across the board, so keep it mellow. Day after brings a solid 3ft @7s W with lighter winds, making it a great day to hit the waves. Best: day after.
