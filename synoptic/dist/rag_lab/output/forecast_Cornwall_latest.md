Today, conditions are challenging across Cornwall with fresh NNW winds at 25–30 mph and a hefty swell of 8–9 ft @ 10s. It's blown out everywhere, so best to give it a miss. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 3–5 ft @ 6–7s but remains messy with SSE winds at 22–34 mph. The day after, the swell picks up to 6–9 ft @ 8–10s, but with similar onshore conditions, it's still not looking great. Best: none.
