Today, Cornwall's North coast is lighting up with 7ft @9s WSW swell and a fresh 16 mph SW wind. Crantock and Fistral are both good bets, especially early and through the mid-day push. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 5ft @10s W swell and light 10 mph S winds, making for a fun day at spots like Porthcurno and Sennen Cove. By the day after, the swell drops to 4ft @8s, but still offers clean options at Crantock and Porthcurno. Best: tomorrow.
