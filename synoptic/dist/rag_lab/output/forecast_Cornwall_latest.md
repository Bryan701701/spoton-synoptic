Today, Cornwall is lighting up with solid 5 ft @ 12s W swell across the North and West coasts, with ESE winds at 13 mph keeping things clean. Crantock and Fistral are prime picks, especially during the early tides from 08:19 to 16:19. Tomorrow sees a drop to 2 ft @ 10s, but Kennack Sands and Falmouth in the South will have some fun 3 ft @ 6s options. By the day after, expect 3 ft @ 9s NW, with the North still holding decent shape. Best: today.
