Today, the West coast is holding up with 8 ft @10s WSW swell and a moderate 16 mph WNW wind. Sennen Cove and Gwenvor are your best bets, offering clean conditions early on the push. Tomorrow, expect a solid 7 ft @13s W swell with light 9 mph S winds, making for great surf at spots like Crantock and Porthcurno. The day after, conditions drop with 4 ft @9s W swell and fresh 17 mph W winds, leading to less favorable surf. Best: tomorrow.
