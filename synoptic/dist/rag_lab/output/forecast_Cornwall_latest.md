Today, conditions are poor across all coasts with fresh onshore winds blowing at 24-42 mph. The North sees 5ft @9s WSW, while the South and West are dealing with larger swells of 4-13ft @10-11s, but all are blown out. Tomorrow, the swell increases significantly to 10-13ft @10-11s, but with strong winds at 42 mph, it remains messy and unworkable. On the day after, conditions improve slightly with 6-8ft @10s, but still facing onshore winds. Best: day after.
