Today in Cornwall, the North coast is firing with clean 7 ft @ 14s W swell and light SSE winds. Crantock and Fistral are prime spots, especially early on the push. Tomorrow sees a drop to 6 ft @ 10s W with fresh SSW winds, making conditions poor across all regions. By the day after, the swell remains at 6 ft but with continued strong winds, keeping it blown out. Best: today.
