Today, the West is looking good with 8 ft @10s WSW swell at Sennen Cove and Gwenvor, both working well with a light 16 mph WNW wind. Best times are early and late, so catch those windows! Tomorrow brings a solid 7 ft @13s W swell across the North and South, with light winds making for clean conditions. Day after, expect a drop to 4 ft @9s, but still some workable options at Porthcurno and Praa Sands. Best: tomorrow.
