Today in Cornwall, the South coast is looking good with Kennack Sands and Falmouth offering 2ft @5s ESE swell, complemented by light 10 mph ENE winds. Best to catch those early tides from 08:18 to 16:23. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 1ft @5s across the board, making it a quiet day. The day after, the South coast sees a bump to 5ft @6s but with fresh 20 mph winds, creating challenging conditions. Best: today.
