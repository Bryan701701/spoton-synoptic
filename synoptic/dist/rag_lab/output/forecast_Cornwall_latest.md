Today in Cornwall, the North coast is lighting up with solid 8 ft @ 14s W swell and light NW winds, making spots like Crantock and Fistral prime for action. Over on the South coast, Porthcurno and Praa Sands are offering fun 5 ft @ 11s SW waves, best early on the push. The West coast is also looking good with 8 ft @ 13s W swell at Sennen Cove and Gwenvor, ideal for a morning session. Tomorrow, expect a slight drop in size but still decent conditions. Day after, winds pick up, making it a bit choppy. Best: today.
