Today in Cornwall, Bude is the standout with 2ft @10s NW and a light 12 mph ENE wind, making for clean conditions. Tomorrow, the North coast continues to produce with similar 2ft @11s W swell, and light winds at 10 mph E, keeping it fun at spots like Town and Watergate Bay. On the day after, expect a drop to 2ft @5s WNW with fresh 13 mph NW winds, making it a bit choppy. Best: today.
