Today, conditions are poor across Cornwall with fresh NW winds at 30 mph creating blown-out surf. The swell is 5 ft @ 6s WNW, but it's not producing any workable waves. Tomorrow looks much better as the wind eases to 9 mph WSW, and swell drops to a cleaner 4 ft @ 7s, with several spots like Crantock and Fistral lighting up. The day after, expect similar conditions but with a stronger swell at 7 ft @ 8s, though winds will pick up again. Best: tomorrow.
