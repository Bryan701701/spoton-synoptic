Today in Cornwall, North is looking solid with 6 ft @9s WSW swell and 14 mph SSW winds. Crantock and Fistral are your best bets, especially during the early tides. Tomorrow, conditions drop, with poor surf across all coasts; winds pick up to 24 mph S, making it a day to skip. On the day after, North sees a slight recovery with 5 ft @12s W swell, but still breezy. Best: today.
