Today in Cornwall, North is lighting up with 7 ft @10s WSW swell and a moderate 14 mph S wind. Crantock and Fistral are prime spots, especially during the early and mid-tide windows. Tomorrow sees a drop to 6 ft @13s W, but the wind shifts to 19 mph NNW, making conditions less favorable. By the day after, expect 5 ft @10s W with fresh 22 mph SSW winds, keeping the North coast pretty blown out. Best: today.
