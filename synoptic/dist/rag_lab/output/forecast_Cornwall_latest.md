Today, it's a no-go across Cornwall with fresh WSW winds at 39 mph creating blown-out conditions. Tomorrow sees a slight drop in swell to 7 ft @12s, but the wind remains fresh at 26 mph, keeping it messy. By the day after, conditions continue to decline with 6 ft @10s and winds at 22 mph, still not producing anything worthwhile. Best: tomorrow.
