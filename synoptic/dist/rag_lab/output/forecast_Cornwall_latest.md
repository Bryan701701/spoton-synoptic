Today, Cornwall is lighting up with solid surf! North spots like Crantock and Fistral are both showing 4ft @10s W with a light SSE breeze, perfect for a fun session. Over in the South, Porthcurno and Praa Sands are also delivering 4ft @9s SW, making for a great day on the beach. The West is not to be missed either, with Sennen Cove and Gwenvor holding 6ft @9s SW, offering some punchy waves. Best: today!
