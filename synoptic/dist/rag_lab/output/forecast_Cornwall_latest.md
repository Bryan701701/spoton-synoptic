Today, North Cornwall is lighting up with 6 ft @ 12s W swell and fresh 17 mph SW winds. Crantock and Fistral are both looking good, especially early on the tides. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 6 ft but drops to 10s, with similar wind conditions, keeping it fun at the same spots. By the day after, conditions worsen with 9 ft swell and strong winds, making it a day to avoid. Best: today.
