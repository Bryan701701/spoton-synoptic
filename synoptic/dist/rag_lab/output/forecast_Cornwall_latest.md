Today in Cornwall, the North coast is lighting up with 7 ft @10s WSW swell and a moderate 14 mph S wind. Crantock and Fistral are great picks, especially during the early tides. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 6 ft @13s W with fresh NNW winds, making it less favorable across the board. By the day after, the swell continues to decline to 5 ft @10s, with stronger winds making it a tough day. Best: today.
