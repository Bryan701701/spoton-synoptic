Today in Cornwall, conditions are poor with 2 ft @8s N swell across the North coast, but fresh 15 mph ENE winds are making it messy. The South coast isn't picking up any swell, and the West is similarly affected with 3 ft @7s ENE swell, but the fresh 30 mph E winds have it blown out. Tomorrow, the North sees some improvement with 2 ft @10s WNW swell, while the South and West remain poor. Day after, Bude offers a little hope with 2 ft @10s NW swell, but overall conditions are still lacking. Best: tomorrow.
