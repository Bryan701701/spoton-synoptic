Today, conditions are poor across all coasts with fresh NW winds at 31 mph, creating blown-out surf. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 8 ft @10s WNW swell, but winds remain strong at 29 mph NW, keeping it messy. By the day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @7s WSW, still under fresh S winds, making for challenging conditions. Best: tomorrow.
