Today in Cornwall, North is lighting up with 5 ft @10s W swell and a light 13 mph S wind. Crantock and Fistral are clean and fun, especially during the early tides. Tomorrow, swell builds to 10 ft @16s W, but expect fresh 16 mph S winds, making it a bit choppy. On the day after, conditions worsen with 10 ft @13s W swell and stronger winds, so it’s looking poor. Best: today.
