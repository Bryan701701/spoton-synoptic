Today, surf is flat across Cornwall with no swell hitting. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with a significant increase in swell to 10 ft @11s, but strong winds at 27 mph from the S will make it blown out. The day after brings a drop to 7 ft @11s, with more manageable winds at 18 mph SSW, offering some workable options at spots like Crantock and Fistral. Best: day after.
