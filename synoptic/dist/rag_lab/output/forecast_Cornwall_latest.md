Today, North is looking fun with 1ft @12s W at Town and Watergate Bay, both best on the early tide from 08:21 to 16:25. South has some workable options too, with Kennack Sands and Falmouth both at 2ft @7s SSE, best early and mid-day. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 2ft @6s WNW across the North, but winds pick up to 16 mph, making it a bit choppy. Day after, the swell increases to 3ft @6s NW, but fresh winds will likely make it messy. Best: today.
