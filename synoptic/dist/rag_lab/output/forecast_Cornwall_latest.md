Today, Cornwall's South coast has some fun options with Porthcurno and Praa Sands both offering 5 ft @ 8s SW, though winds are a moderate 18 mph NW. The West coast is looking solid with Sennen Cove and Gwenvor lighting up at 7 ft @ 10s W, also under 17 mph NW winds. Tomorrow, expect a drop to 5 ft @ 9s WNW across the North, while the South and West will see smaller 2 ft @ 8s conditions. The day after, conditions will be less favorable with strong winds making it blown out. Best: today.
