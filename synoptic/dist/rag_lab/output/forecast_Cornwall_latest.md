Today, West is looking good with 8 ft @10s WSW swell and a light 16 mph WNW wind. Sennen Cove and Gwenvor are clean early, perfect for catching some fun waves. Tomorrow, conditions improve further with 7 ft @13s W swell and light 9 mph S winds, making for great surf at Crantock and Porthcurno. Day after, expect a drop to 4 ft @9s with fresh onshore winds, making it less favorable. Best: tomorrow.
