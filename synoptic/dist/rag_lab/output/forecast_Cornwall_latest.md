Today, conditions are poor across Cornwall with fresh NNW winds at 25-30 mph and a hefty swell of 8-9 ft @10s. It's blown out at all spots, so best to give it a miss. Tomorrow sees a slight drop in swell to 3-5 ft @6-7s, but winds remain fresh, keeping it messy. The day after, swell picks up again to 6-9 ft @8-10s, but with similar wind conditions, it will still be challenging. Best: none.
