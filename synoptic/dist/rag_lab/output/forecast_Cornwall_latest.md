Today in Cornwall, North is clean and fun with 1ft @12s W swell and light E winds, perfect for a session at Town or Watergate Bay. South has some workable options too, with 2ft @7s SSE at Kennack Sands and Falmouth, though the wind is a bit fresher. Tomorrow, North sees a slight uptick to 2ft @6s WNW with moderate WNW winds, while South drops to 1ft @8s WSW, not quite as inviting. Day after, conditions worsen with 3ft @6s NW and fresh winds across the board, making it less appealing. Best: today.
