Today, surf is on the quieter side with poor conditions across all coasts. North and West are seeing 4ft @8s NNW, but fresh ENE winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell picks up slightly to 6ft @7s in the South, but the wind remains fresh, keeping it messy. The day after, conditions drop further with 2ft @6s across most spots, making for a slow day. Best: tomorrow.
