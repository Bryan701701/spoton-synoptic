Today in Cornwall, Bude is the standout with clean 2ft @10s NW swell and 12 mph ENE winds, best enjoyed from 08:21 to 16:20. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with a similar 2ft @11s W swell across multiple spots like Town and Watergate Bay, with light 10 mph E winds. On New Year's Day, expect a drop to 2ft @5s WNW with fresh NW winds, making it less appealing. Best: today.
