Today, Cornwall's North coast is lighting up with 5 ft @ 7s W swell and 12 mph WNW winds. Crantock and Fistral are both solid picks, especially on the mid-tide push. Tomorrow, conditions take a turn with 7 ft @ 8s WNW swell and fresh 25 mph NW winds, making it blown out across the region. The day after, the swell remains at 7 ft but with similar strong winds, keeping it poor. Best: today.
