Today, Cornwall is lighting up with solid surf! North spots like Crantock and Fistral are offering 8ft @ 14s W with light NW winds, perfect for an early session. Tomorrow, expect a slight drop to 7ft @ 14s W across the North, still clean with SSW winds. On the day after, the swell continues to ease to 6ft @ 10s W, but winds pick up, making it a bit choppy. Best: today.
