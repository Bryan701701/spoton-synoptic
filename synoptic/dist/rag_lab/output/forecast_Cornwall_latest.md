Today, Cornwall is experiencing poor conditions with fresh WSW winds at 20-25 mph and swells around 9-11 ft, making it blown out across all coasts. Tomorrow, conditions remain poor with similar wind and swell patterns, though the swell drops slightly to 5-7 ft. On the day after, expect a shift as cleaner conditions arrive with 6 ft swells at 13s and light ESE winds, offering some fun options at spots like Crantock and Porthcurno. Best: day after.
