Today, Bude is offering clean 2ft @5s NW with light NNW winds, perfect for a fun session. Sennen Cove is also working at 3ft @6s NNW, though with a fresh 14 mph NNW breeze, so keep an eye on the conditions. Tomorrow, expect a drop in size with poor conditions across the board as wind picks up. Day after, conditions improve with 3ft @7s WSW at several spots, including Crantock and Sennen. Best: today.
