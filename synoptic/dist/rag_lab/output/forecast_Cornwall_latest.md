Today, Cornwall is lighting up with fun surf! North spots like Crantock and Fistral are offering 3ft @10s W, with light E winds keeping it clean—best early and mid. South is also looking good, with Porthcurno and Praa Sands serving up 3ft @10s SW, light ENE winds making for a pleasant session. Over on the West, Sennen Cove and Gwenvor are showing 4ft @10s WSW, with ESE winds grooming the waves nicely—ideal for all levels. Best: today.
