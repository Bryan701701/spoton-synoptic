Today, North Cornwall is looking solid with 6 ft @9s WSW swell and a fresh 14 mph SSW wind. Crantock and Fistral are your best bets, especially during the early tides. Tomorrow, conditions drop with the swell still around 6 ft but winds pick up to 24 mph, making it poor across the board. Day after, the swell eases to 5 ft @12s with a lighter 17 mph N wind, improving conditions at North spots like Crantock and Fistral. Best: today.
