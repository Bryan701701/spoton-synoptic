Today, Cornwall is experiencing poor conditions with a strong 19 mph SW wind and 7 ft @10s W swell across the North coast. The South and West coasts are also struggling, with similar conditions and even stronger winds. Tomorrow, a slight improvement is expected with 6 ft @11s W swell and lighter 15 mph S winds in the North, while the South and West remain poor. By the day after, North coast spots like Crantock and Fistral will light up with 7 ft @14s W swell and light winds. Best: day after.
