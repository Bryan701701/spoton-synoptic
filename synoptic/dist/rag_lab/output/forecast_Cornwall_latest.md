Today, it's a tough call with all coasts experiencing blown out conditions due to fresh WSW winds at 39 mph. Swell is hefty at 14 ft @12s, but the wind is making it messy everywhere. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 7 ft @12s with winds easing to 26 mph SW, still not ideal. The day after, conditions remain poor with 6 ft @10s and winds at 22 mph SW. Best: tomorrow.
