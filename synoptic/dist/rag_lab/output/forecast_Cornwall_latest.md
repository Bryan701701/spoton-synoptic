Today is quiet across Cornwall with 2 ft @8s lines, but the fresh 18 mph ENE wind is making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 3 ft @6s, though the wind picks up to 26 mph E, still not ideal. By the day after, we can expect 2 ft @11s WNW with light 7 mph E winds, offering some fun options at spots like Town and Watergate Bay. Best: day after.
