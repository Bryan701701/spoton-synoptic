Today, Cornwall is lighting up with solid surf! North spots like Crantock and Fistral are delivering 7 ft @ 14s W with light ESE winds, making for clean conditions. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 5 ft @ 12s, still workable at Crantock and Fistral, but expect a bit more wind from the ENE. By the day after, surf settles to 3 ft @ 9s, with gentle SSE winds—perfect for a relaxed session. Best: today.
