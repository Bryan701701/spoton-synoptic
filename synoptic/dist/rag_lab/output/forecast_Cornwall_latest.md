Today, conditions are poor across Cornwall with fresh NNW winds at 21-28 mph and swell around 3-4 ft @ 5-6s. It's blown out everywhere, so best to give it a miss. Tomorrow sees a slight drop in swell to 2-3 ft @ 7s, but still with fresh NNW winds making it unworkable. The day after continues the trend with similar conditions, keeping the surf flat and messy. Best: none.
