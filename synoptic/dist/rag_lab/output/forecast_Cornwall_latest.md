Today, North Cornwall is lighting up with 7ft @9s WSW swell and fresh 16 mph SW winds. Crantock and Fistral are your best bets, especially early on the push. Tomorrow, the swell drops to a fun 5ft @10s with light S winds, making for clean conditions at Crantock and Porthcurno. Day after, expect 4ft @8s WNW swell with light winds, still offering good options at Crantock and Porthcurno. Best: tomorrow.
