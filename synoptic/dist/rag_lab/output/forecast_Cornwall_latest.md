Today, Cornwall is lighting up with solid surf! The North is seeing 9ft @17s W with S winds at 14 mph, making spots like Fistral and Town good choices. The South is offering fun 5ft @11s SW at Porthcurno and Praa Sands, with light SSW winds. Over on the West, Sennen Cove and Gwenvor are both 9ft @14s W, clean early with light SW winds. Tomorrow, expect a drop in conditions across all coasts, with the North and South going poor due to strong winds. The day after continues the trend with poor surf. Best: today.
