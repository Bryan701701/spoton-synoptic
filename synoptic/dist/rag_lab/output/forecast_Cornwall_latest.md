Today, the South coast has some fun options with Porthcurno and Praa Sands both offering 5ft @8s SW, but watch for the NW wind at 18 mph. Over on the West, Sennen Cove, Gwenvor, and Porthmeor are lighting up with 7ft @10s W, also with a fresh NW breeze. Tomorrow, the North coast picks up to 5ft @9s WNW, while the South and West see smaller 2ft @8s conditions. Day after, expect a drop to 7ft @8s with strong winds, making it less appealing. Best: today.
