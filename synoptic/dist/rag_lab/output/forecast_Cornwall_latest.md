Today, surf is quiet across Cornwall with 2 ft @8s lines, but fresh ENE winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight uptick to 3 ft @6s, though it remains poor with strong E winds. By the day after, conditions improve to 2 ft @11s, with light E winds providing a cleaner surf experience at spots like Town and Watergate Bay. Best: day after.
