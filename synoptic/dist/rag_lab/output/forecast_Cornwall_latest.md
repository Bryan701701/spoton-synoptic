Today, Cornwall is lighting up with solid 7ft @ 14s W swell and light SSE winds. North spots like Crantock and Fistral are prime, especially early on the push. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 6ft @ 10s W swell and fresh SSW winds, making it less appealing across the board. By the day after, the swell remains at 6ft but with stronger S winds, keeping it poor. Best: today.
