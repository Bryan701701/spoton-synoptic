Today in The South, it's looking fun with 2 ft @8s SSW swell and light 9 mph NNW winds. Derrynane and Barley Cove are clean and working well, especially on the push. Tomorrow drops to 1 ft @9s SSW with a moderate 13 mph NW wind, so it’ll be a bit weaker but still rideable at the best times. Day after, conditions go flat with 1 ft @5s W, so it’s a good day to take a break. Best: today.
