Today on the Causeway Coast, conditions are poor with 5 ft @10s NW swell and fresh 19 mph W wind, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 5 ft @9s NW swell and moderate 16 mph S wind, but still not producing great surf. By the day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @9s WNW, with similar wind conditions, keeping it on the lower end of workable. Best: tomorrow.
