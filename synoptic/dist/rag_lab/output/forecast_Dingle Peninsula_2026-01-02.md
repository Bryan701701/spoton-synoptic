Today on the Dingle Peninsula, conditions are poor with a fresh 22 mph N wind and 5 ft @9s NNW swell, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 5 ft @8s NNW swell and lighter 15 mph NNE winds, offering some workable options at spots like Ballybunion. By the day after, the swell drops to 4 ft @10s NNW with light 4 mph ENE winds, creating cleaner conditions at the same locations. Best: day after.
