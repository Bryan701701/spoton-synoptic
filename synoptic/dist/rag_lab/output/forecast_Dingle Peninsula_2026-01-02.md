Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it's a bit of a struggle with 5 ft @9s NNW swell and fresh 22 mph N winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement as the swell holds at 5 ft @8s NNW with lighter 15 mph NNE winds, making it more workable at spots like Ballybunion. The day after brings cleaner conditions with 4 ft @10s NNW swell and light 4 mph ENE winds, perfect for a fun session. Best: day after.
