Today in Northwest Wales, it's a bit of a bummer with 1 ft @ 4s ENE swell and fresh 15 mph ENE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow looks similar with the same swell size and direction but slightly lighter winds at 10 mph E. Day after brings a bit of a change with 1 ft @ 7s NW swell, still not much to write home about, but winds ease to 9 mph ENE. Best: day after.
