Today in Northwest Wales, it's looking fun with 2 ft @9s WSW swell and light 7 mph S winds. Porth Oer and Hells Mouth (beach) are great picks, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 5 ft @7s SW swell and fresh 22 mph SSW winds, making it blown out and poor across the coast. The day after, it stays poor with 4 ft @8s SW swell and 20 mph S winds. Best: today.
