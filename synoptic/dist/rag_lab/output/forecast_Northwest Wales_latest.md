Today in Northwest Wales, it's flat with no surf—swell isn’t getting in and the light ENE wind isn’t helping. Tomorrow sees a slight bump to 1 ft @5s, but fresh 16 mph E winds will create some chop. Day after, conditions remain similar with 1 ft @6s, still onshore with 13 mph E winds. Best: tomorrow.
