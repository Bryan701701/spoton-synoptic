Today in Northwest Wales, it's looking pretty quiet with 2 ft @9s SW swell, but fresh 12 mph ESE winds are making it a bit messy. Tomorrow drops to 1 ft @8s WSW with light 5 mph ENE winds, so not much happening. The day after, conditions remain similar with 1 ft @5s NNE swell and light 7 mph NE winds. Best: today.
