Today in Northwest Wales, it's a bit of a struggle with 3 ft @ 5s WNW swell and fresh 20 mph WNW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 4 ft @ 6s NW swell, but the fresh 19 mph NNW winds will still keep it choppy. Day after, Porth Oer lights up with 4 ft @ 5s NW and lighter 11 mph N winds, offering the best conditions of the three days. Best: day after.
