Today in Northwest Wales, it's flat with no surf on the horizon—swell isn't hitting this coast. Tomorrow sees a slight bump to 1 ft @11s from the W, with light NE winds, but still not much to write home about. Day after holds similar conditions, 1 ft @9s from the NW, with light ENE winds. Best: tomorrow.
