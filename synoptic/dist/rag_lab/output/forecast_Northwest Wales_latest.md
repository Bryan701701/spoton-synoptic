Today in Northwest Wales, it's flat with no surf—swell isn't getting in and the light ENE wind isn't helping. Tomorrow sees a slight bump to 1 ft @5s, but with fresh 16 mph E winds, it’ll be choppy and not very inviting. The day after, conditions remain similar with 1 ft @6s and 13 mph E winds. Best: day after.
