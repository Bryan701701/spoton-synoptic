Today in Northwest Wales, it's a bit of a struggle with 3 ft @5s WNW swell and fresh 20 mph WNW winds creating a blown-out scene. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 4 ft @6s NW swell, but the fresh 19 mph NNW wind will still keep things messy. Day after, Porth Oer lights up with 4 ft @5s NW and lighter 11 mph N winds, offering a cleaner ride. Best: day after.
