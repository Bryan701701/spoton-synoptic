Today in Northwest Wales, it's a quiet one with 1 ft @14s WSW swell and light 3 mph SE winds. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 3 ft @5s WNW, but fresh 18 mph WNW winds will make it blown out. The day after, conditions improve with 4 ft @6s NW swell and light 7 mph N winds, offering some fun waves at Porth Oer. Best: day after.
