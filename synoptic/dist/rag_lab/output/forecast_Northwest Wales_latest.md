Today in Northwest Wales, it's a quiet day with 2 ft @5s NW swell and light 1 mph SW winds. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 2 ft @4s WNW swell, but fresh 12 mph WNW winds will add some chop. On the day after, the swell picks up to 4 ft @6s NW with 18 mph NNW winds, making it a bit messy. Best: day after.
