Today in Northwest Wales, it's looking pretty quiet with 1 ft @ 4s ENE swell and fresh 15 mph ENE winds. Tomorrow, similar conditions persist with 1 ft @ 4s NE swell and 10 mph E winds, so still not much happening. On the day after, the swell remains at 1 ft but picks up to 7s, with light 9 mph ENE winds—still not producing much. Best: day after.
