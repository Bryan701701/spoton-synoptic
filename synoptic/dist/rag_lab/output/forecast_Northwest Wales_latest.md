Today in Northwest Wales, it's a quiet scene with 5 ft @8s SW swell but fresh 25 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 6 ft @9s WSW swell and lighter 15 mph SSW winds, making for some workable conditions at spots like Hells Mouth and Porth Oer. By the day after, the swell drops to 4 ft @8s WSW, but the wind picks up again to 19 mph S, keeping it poor across the region. Best: tomorrow.
