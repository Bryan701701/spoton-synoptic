Today in Northwest Wales, Porth Oer is showing some fun surf at 3 ft @ 6s WNW with a fresh 14 mph NW wind. It's a good time to hit the water, especially between 14:45 and 16:35. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 6 ft @ 7s SW with a stronger 23 mph SSW wind, making it blown out and poor across the board. The day after, Porth Oer and Hells Mouth pick up again with 3 ft @ 7s WSW and a lighter 14 mph S wind, offering some workable waves. Best: today.
