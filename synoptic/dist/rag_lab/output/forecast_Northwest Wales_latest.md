Today in Northwest Wales, conditions are quiet with 2 ft @5s NW swell and light 1 mph SW winds. Tomorrow, similar 2 ft @4s WNW swell continues but with fresh 12 mph WNW winds, making it a bit choppy. On the day after, the swell picks up to 4 ft @6s NW, but fresh 18 mph NNW winds will likely create some messy conditions. Best: today.
