Today in Northwest Wales, it's a quiet day with 2 ft @5s NW swell and a light 6 mph SE wind. Tomorrow looks better with Porth Oer lighting up at 2 ft @5s NW and gentle 3 mph SSE winds, offering a fun morning session. The day after, conditions drop again with a fresh 16 mph WNW wind making it blown out across the region. Best: tomorrow.
