Northwest Wales is looking solid today with 3 ft @12s WSW swell and light SE winds at 9 mph. Porth Oer and Hells Mouth (beach) are great picks, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 1 ft @10s, with E winds at 12 mph making it a flat day. The day after, it stays flat at 1 ft @9s with light ENE winds. Best: today.
