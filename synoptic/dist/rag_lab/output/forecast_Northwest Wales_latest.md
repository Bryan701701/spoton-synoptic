Today in Northwest Wales, Porth Oer is showing some fun with 3 ft @6s WNW and a fresh 14 mph NW wind. It's a good time to hit the water, especially between 14:45 and 16:35. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 6 ft @7s SW with a strong 23 mph SSW wind, making it blown out and poor across the board. Day after, Porth Oer and Hells Mouth see a return to 3 ft @7s WSW with a lighter 14 mph S wind, offering some workable options. Best: today.
