Today in Northwest Wales, it's a quiet one with 3 ft @7s SW swell but fresh 18 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow looks much better as conditions improve with 3 ft @8s WSW swell and light 8 mph S winds, creating clean surf at spots like Porth Oer and Hells Mouth. The day after, the swell picks up to 8 ft @9s WSW with moderate 15 mph SW winds; still some fun waves at sheltered corners. Best: tomorrow.
