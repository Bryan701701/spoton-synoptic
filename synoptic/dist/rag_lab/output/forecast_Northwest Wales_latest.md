Today in Northwest Wales, it's a good day with 3 ft @ 8s WSW swell and light 9 mph S winds. Porth Oer and Hells Mouth (beach) are great spots to hit, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, swell picks up to 7 ft @ 8s WSW, but with fresh 15 mph SSW winds, so expect some chop. The day after, conditions ease a bit with 4 ft @ 7s SW and 17 mph SSE winds, still workable at sheltered corners. Best: today.
