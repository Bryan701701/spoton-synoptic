Today in Northwest Wales, Porth Oer is holding at 4 ft @ 6s NNW with fresh 12 mph N winds; it’s workable but not ideal. Tomorrow, conditions improve with a clean 2 ft @ 5s NW and light 2 mph NE winds, making it a fun time to hit the water at Porth Oer during the early tide window. The day after also looks good with similar conditions at Porth Oer, 2 ft @ 5s NW and light 3 mph ENE winds. Best: tomorrow.
