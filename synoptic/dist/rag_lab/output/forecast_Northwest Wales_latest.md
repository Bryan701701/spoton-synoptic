Today in Northwest Wales, it's looking pretty quiet with 1 ft @ 4s ENE swell and fresh 15 mph ENE winds. Tomorrow remains similar with 1 ft @ 4s NE swell and moderate 10 mph E winds, not much to get excited about. The day after, we see a slight uptick to 1 ft @ 7s NW, but still not producing anything noteworthy. Best: day after.
