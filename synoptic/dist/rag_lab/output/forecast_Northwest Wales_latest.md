Today in Northwest Wales, Porth Oer is showing some potential with 3 ft @ 7s WNW and fresh 16 mph NNW winds. It's a bit choppy, but the early window from 10:59 to 12:49 should offer some workable conditions. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 2 ft @ 9s WSW and light 4 mph ESE winds, making for a fun day at spots like Hells Mouth. Day after, expect 2 ft @ 5s SSW with fresh 21 mph SSE winds, likely leading to blown-out conditions. Best: tomorrow.
