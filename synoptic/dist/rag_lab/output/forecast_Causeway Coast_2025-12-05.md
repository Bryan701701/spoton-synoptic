Today, the Causeway Coast is seeing poor conditions with 3 ft @14s WNW swell, but fresh 20 mph SSE winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, it drops to 1 ft @9s W with similar onshore winds, so it's not producing. By the day after, Portballintrae shows a slight improvement with 1 ft @8s W, but still not much to ride. Best: day after.
