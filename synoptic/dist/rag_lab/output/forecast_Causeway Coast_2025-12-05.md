Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking poor with 3 ft @14s WNW swell but fresh 20 mph SSE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow drops to 1 ft @9s W, still with 18 mph S winds, so not producing. The day after, conditions remain similar with 1 ft @8s W swell and 15 mph S winds, offering limited options. Best: today.
