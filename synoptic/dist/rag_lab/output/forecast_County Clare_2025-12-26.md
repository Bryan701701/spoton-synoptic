Today in County Clare, surf is small at 2 ft @9s WNW with fresh 11 mph NE wind creating some chop. Tomorrow holds similar conditions with 2 ft @9s W, but winds ease to 5 mph NNE, making it a bit cleaner. Day after, still 2 ft @10s WNW with light 8 mph E winds, but remains on the poor side. Best: tomorrow.
