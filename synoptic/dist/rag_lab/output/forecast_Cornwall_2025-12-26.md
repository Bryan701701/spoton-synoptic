Today, Cornwall's South coast is looking good with Kennack Sands and Falmouth both offering 2ft @ 5s ESE swell, complemented by light 10 mph ENE winds. Best times to hit the water are early at Kennack Sands from 08:18–16:23 and Falmouth from 09:05–16:22. The North and West coasts are quiet, with poor conditions across the board. Tomorrow, expect a drop in swell to 1ft with similar poor conditions continuing. Day after, the South remains flat while the North and West are still not producing. Best: today.
