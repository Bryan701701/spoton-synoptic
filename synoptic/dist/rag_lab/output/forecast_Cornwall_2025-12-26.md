Today in Cornwall, the South coast is shining with Kennack Sands and Falmouth offering clean 2ft @5s ESE waves, thanks to light ENE winds. Best surf times are during the early tides from 08:18 to 16:23. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 1ft @5s across the board, making it a quiet day. The day after, we see a slight increase to 5ft @6s, but fresh E winds will make it challenging. Best: today.
