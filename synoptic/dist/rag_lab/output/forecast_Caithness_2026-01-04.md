Today in Caithness, conditions are poor with a fresh 24 mph NNW wind creating a blown-out situation. The swell is around 3 ft @ 6s, but it's not producing any workable waves. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 6 ft @ 9s from the N, though still affected by 18 mph N winds. The day after, conditions get much better with clean 4 ft @ 7s waves and light 7 mph S winds. Best: day after.
