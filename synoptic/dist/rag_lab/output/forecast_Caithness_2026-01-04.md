Today in Caithness, conditions are poor with 3 ft @6s N swell, but fresh 24 mph NNW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 6 ft @9s N swell and 18 mph N winds, offering some workable options at spots like Point of Ness and Thurso East. The day after brings good conditions with 4 ft @7s NW swell and light 7 mph S winds, making it a fun day for surfing. Best: day after.
