Today in Northwest Wales, it's looking pretty flat with 1 ft @6s SW swell and light 5 mph E winds. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 1 ft @4s ENE swell and moderate 11 mph ENE winds, keeping it on the poor side. Day after, the swell stays at 1 ft @4s ENE, but winds pick up to 18 mph E, making it even less inviting. Best: today.
