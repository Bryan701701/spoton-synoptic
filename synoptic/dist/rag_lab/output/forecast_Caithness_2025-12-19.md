Today in Caithness, it's a bit of a struggle with fresh 29 mph SSW winds creating a blown-out scene. The swell is 3 ft @ 6s SSE, but conditions are poor across the board, so it’s best to give it a miss. Tomorrow, things improve significantly with 4 ft @ 11s WNW swell and light 9 mph S winds, making for clean, fun surf at spots like Point of Ness and Murkle Point. The day after, expect 4 ft @ 13s W swell, but with fresh 24 mph SE winds, conditions will be less favorable again. Best: tomorrow.
