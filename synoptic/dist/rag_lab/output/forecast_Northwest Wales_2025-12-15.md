Today in Northwest Wales, it’s looking fun with 4 ft @8s WSW swell and light 7 mph SSW winds. Porth Oer and Hells Mouth (beach) are the top picks, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow drops to 2 ft @10s, with light winds making it a quiet day. The day after sees a bump to 3 ft @7s but with fresh 19 mph SSE winds, making it blown out. Best: today.
