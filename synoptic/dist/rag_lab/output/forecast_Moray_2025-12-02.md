Today in Moray, Spey Bay and Lossiemouth are both clean and fun, offering 2 ft @ 9s NNE with light 7 mph WSW winds. Ideal conditions from mid-morning through the afternoon. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 1 ft @ 6s ESE with fresh 22 mph SSE winds, making it poor across the board. The day after sees similar 1 ft @ 7s E conditions with moderate 14 mph SSE winds, still not great. Best: today.
