Today in Moray, Spey Bay and Lossiemouth are both offering fun 2 ft @ 9s NNE with light 7 mph WSW winds, making for clean conditions. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 1 ft @ 6s ESE with fresh 22 mph SSE winds, so it’s best to give it a miss. Day after, similar 1 ft @ 7s E conditions persist, still not ideal. Best: today.
