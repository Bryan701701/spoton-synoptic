Today in Moray, Spey Bay and Lossiemouth are both clean and fun at 2 ft @9s NNE with light 7 mph WSW winds. Ideal conditions from mid-morning to late afternoon. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 1 ft @6s with fresh 22 mph SSE winds, making it a flat day across the coast. The day after sees similar 1 ft @7s E conditions with 14 mph SSE winds, still not much to ride. Best: today.
