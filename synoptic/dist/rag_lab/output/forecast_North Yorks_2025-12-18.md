Today, it’s pretty quiet with 1 ft @4s S swell across the North Yorks coast, and fresh 16 mph SW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight bump to 2 ft @4s SSW, but with strong 28 mph SW winds, it’ll be choppy and messy. The day after drops back down to 1 ft @3s S, with light 8 mph SSW winds, but still not looking great. Best: tomorrow.
