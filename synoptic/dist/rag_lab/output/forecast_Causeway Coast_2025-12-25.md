Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking fun with 3 ft @11s NW swell and light 5 mph E winds. Both White Park Bay and Portballintrae are clean and working well, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @9s NW, still decent at Portballintrae but with a bit more wind at 9 mph ESE. Day after, conditions decline with 2 ft @6s NE and fresh 15 mph E winds, making it less appealing. Best: today.
