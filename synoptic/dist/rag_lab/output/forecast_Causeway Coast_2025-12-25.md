Today on the Causeway Coast, White Park Bay and Portballintrae are lighting up with 3 ft @11s NW swell and light 5 mph E winds, making for clean conditions. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @9s NW with a moderate 9 mph ESE wind; Portballintrae will still have some fun waves. Day after, conditions decline with 2 ft @6s NE swell and fresh 15 mph E winds, making it less inviting. Best: today.
