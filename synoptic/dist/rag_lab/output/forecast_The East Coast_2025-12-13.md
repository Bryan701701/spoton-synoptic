Today on the East Coast, it’s a bit of a struggle with 2 ft @5s S swell and fresh 22 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 3 ft @6s S swell, but the 19 mph SW winds will still keep things choppy. By the day after, conditions really turn around with 3 ft @7s SSE swell and light 3 mph NE winds, offering clean surf at spots like Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay. Best: day after.
