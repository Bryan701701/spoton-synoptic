Today in Sutherland, it's a fun day with 3 ft @ 8s NW swell and fresh 18 mph SSE winds. Good spots like Melvich and Strathy are working well, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, expect a bump to 4 ft @ 10s WNW with lighter 12 mph SSW winds, making for a cleaner session. The day after, surf continues to build to 5 ft @ 9s NW, still holding shape with similar winds. Best: tomorrow.
