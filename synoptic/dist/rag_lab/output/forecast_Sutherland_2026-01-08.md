Sutherland is looking fun today with 3 ft @ 8s NW swell and fresh 18 mph SSE winds. Melvich and Strathy are your best bets, with windows from 10:06–11:56 and 09:01–15:44 respectively. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 4 ft @ 10s WNW with lighter 12 mph SSW winds, keeping conditions clean at spots like Melvich and Strathy. Day after, we see a further increase to 5 ft @ 9s NW, still with manageable winds. Best: tomorrow.
