Today in the Hebrides, it's a bit of a bummer with 4 ft @9s S swell and fresh 23 mph ESE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, things take a turn for the better with 6 ft @12s SW swell and light 11 mph SE winds, making for some clean conditions at spots like Europie and Barvas. On the day after, the surf remains fun at 5 ft @10s WSW, but with a moderate 14 mph SW wind, it may be a bit choppy. Best: tomorrow.
