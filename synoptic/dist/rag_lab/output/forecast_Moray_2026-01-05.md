Today in Moray, it's looking fun with 3 ft @ 7s NNE swell and light 6 mph ENE winds. Fraserburgh and Pennan are the top picks, both offering clean conditions from morning into the afternoon. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 2 ft @ 7s NNE with moderate 10 mph SW winds, still workable at the same spots. Day after, expect 3 ft @ 5s N with fresh 26 mph NW winds, making it blown out and poor across the board. Best: today.
