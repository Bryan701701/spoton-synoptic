Today in Moray, Fraserburgh and Pennan are lighting up with clean 3 ft @ 7s NNE swell and light ENE winds, perfect for a fun session. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 7s with a moderate SW breeze, still workable at spots like Fraserburgh and Banff. Day after, expect poor conditions with 3 ft @ 5s N swell and fresh NW winds, making it blown out across the board. Best: today.
