Today, Dingle Peninsula is offering some fun surf with 3 ft @10s WNW swell and fresh 18 mph E winds. Ballybunion Right and Ballybunion Beach are your best bets, especially during the tide window from 08:49 to 16:33. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 2 ft @9s W swell and light 8 mph WSW winds, making for a clean day at the same spots. Day after, expect 5 ft @9s NNW swell but fresh 21 mph NNW winds will likely make it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
