Today, Dingle Peninsula is looking solid with 3 ft @10s WNW swell and fresh 18 mph E winds. Ballybunion Right and Ballybunion Beach are the top picks, especially during the tide window from 08:49 to 16:33. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 2 ft @9s W swell and light 8 mph WSW winds, making for a fun day at the same spots. Day after, expect 5 ft @9s NNW swell but fresh 21 mph NNW winds will make it blown out and poor. Best: tomorrow.
