Today, the South is quiet with no surf action—wrong swell angle and fresh onshore winds. Tomorrow, conditions improve significantly with a clean 5 ft @ 8s SSW swell and light NNE winds, making it a great day to hit the beach. The day after, surf drops to 2 ft @ 8s SSW with moderate WNW winds, still workable at some spots like Derrynane and Barley Cove. Best: tomorrow.
