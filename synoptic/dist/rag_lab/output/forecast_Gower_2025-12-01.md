Today, Gower is seeing some big swell at 7 ft @ 7s SW, but fresh 27 mph SSW winds are making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 5 ft @ 8s WSW with 20 mph SW winds, still not ideal for surfing. By the day after, conditions improve slightly with 5 ft @ 10s WSW and lighter 13 mph SW winds, offering a better chance for some fun waves at spots like Llangennith Beach. Best: day after.
