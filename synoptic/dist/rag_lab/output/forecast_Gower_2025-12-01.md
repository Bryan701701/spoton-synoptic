Today on Gower, conditions are poor with a hefty 7 ft @ 7s SW swell and fresh 24 mph SSW winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 5 ft @ 8s WSW swell and moderate 16 mph SW winds; some sheltered corners like Llangennith Beach may offer workable conditions during the tide windows. The day after, the swell holds at 6 ft @ 11s WSW but remains poor with 22 mph SSW winds. Best: tomorrow.
