Today in Caithness, it's looking solid with 4ft @12s NW swell and light 9 mph SSE winds. Point of Ness and Dunnet Bay are both firing, offering great conditions during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop as the swell weakens to 3ft @5s SE with fresh 24 mph SSE winds, making it poor across the board. However, the day after brings a nice rebound with 5ft @15s NW swell and light 10 mph SE winds, making it a prime day at spots like Point of Ness and Murkle Point. Best: day after.
