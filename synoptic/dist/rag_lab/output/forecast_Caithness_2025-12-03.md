Today in Caithness, it's looking solid with 4ft @12s NW swell and light 9 mph SSE winds. Good spots like Point of Ness and Dunnet Bay are firing, especially during the mid-tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 3ft @5s SE swell and fresh 24 mph SSE winds, making it a poor day for surf. Day after, we see a nice rebound with 5ft @15s NW swell and light 10 mph SE winds, perfect for catching some fun waves. Best: day after.
