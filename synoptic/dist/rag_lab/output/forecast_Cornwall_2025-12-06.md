Today, Cornwall is seeing poor conditions with a strong 39 mph WSW wind and 14 ft @ 12s W swell across the north, south, and west coasts—definitely blown out. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 7 ft @ 12s W with a lighter 26 mph SW wind, but still not producing much. By the day after, conditions remain poor with 6 ft @ 10s W swell and 22 mph SW winds. Best: tomorrow.
