Today, conditions are challenging across Cornwall with fresh WSW winds at 39 mph creating blown-out surf. The swell is hefty at 14 ft @ 12s, but it's not producing any workable waves. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 7 ft @ 12s with winds easing to 26 mph SW; still not ideal. By the day after, the swell further decreases to 6 ft @ 10s, but winds remain fresh, keeping it messy. Best: tomorrow.
