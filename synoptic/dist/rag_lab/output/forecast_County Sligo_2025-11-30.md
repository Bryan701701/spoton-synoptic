County Sligo is looking solid! Today, expect 4 ft @10s NNW with a fresh 11 mph WNW wind. Good spots like Dunmoran Strand and Easkey Right will be working well, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @9s NW with a moderate 14 mph S wind, making Strandhill the only option. By the day after, we see a significant swell increase to 8 ft @14s WNW, with Easkey Right and Left offering some fun rides, though the wind will be SSW at 13 mph. Best: today.
