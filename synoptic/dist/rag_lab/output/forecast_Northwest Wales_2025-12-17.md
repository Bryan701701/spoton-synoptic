Today in Northwest Wales, it's a bit of a bummer with poor conditions: 3 ft @7s SW and fresh 18 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow brings a nice improvement with 3 ft @8s WSW, lightening winds at 8 mph S, and some workable tides at spots like Hells Mouth and Porth Oer. The day after, we see a solid swell at 8 ft @9s WSW, but with 15 mph SW winds, it might be a bit choppy. Best: tomorrow.
