Today on the West Coast, it’s looking solid with 7 ft @ 14s WNW swell and light 12 mph S winds. Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay are your best bets, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 10s WSW with fresh 15 mph S winds, still workable but not as punchy. Day after, expect 4 ft @ 10s W with stronger 20 mph SSW winds, likely making it blown out. Best: today.
