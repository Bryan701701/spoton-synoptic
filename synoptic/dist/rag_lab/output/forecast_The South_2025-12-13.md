Today in The South, it’s a bit rough with 3 ft @7s SSW swell and fresh 25 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 6 ft @7s SSW, but the same strong winds will keep conditions poor. By the day after, we see a nice improvement with 5 ft @8s SSW, light 10 mph NW winds, and workable conditions at spots like Ballinskelligs Bay. Best: day after.
