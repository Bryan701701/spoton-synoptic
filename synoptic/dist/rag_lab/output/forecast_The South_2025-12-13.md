Today, the South is quiet with 3 ft @7s SSW swell, but fresh 25 mph SSW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a bump to 6 ft @7s SSW, but the same strong winds will keep conditions poor. By the day after, things improve with 5 ft @8s SSW and light 10 mph NW winds, creating a fun surf day. Best: day after.
