Today on the Causeway Coast, White Park Bay and Portballintrae are both clean and fun, with 4 ft @10s WNW swell and light 11 mph SSE winds. Tomorrow, conditions take a turn for the worse with fresh 35 mph ESE winds, making it blown out and not producing. By the day after, the wind eases to a light 4 mph NE, bringing back some clean 4 ft @12s WNW surf at White Park Bay and Portballintrae. Best: today.
