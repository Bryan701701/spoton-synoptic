Today in North Devon, it's looking great with 4 ft @ 13s WSW swell and light ESE winds at 8 mph. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are both solid choices, with Lynmouth best around 08:17–16:09. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 3 ft @ 12s, but Woolacombe and Putsborough will still be fun, especially on the mid-tide push. By the day after, conditions ease further to 1 ft @ 9s, making it more suitable for beginners at spots like Woolacombe and Putsborough. Best: today.
