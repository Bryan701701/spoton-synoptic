Today in North Devon, it's looking solid with 4 ft @ 13s WSW swell and light ESE winds at 8 mph. Spots like Woolacombe and Putsborough are prime for some fun waves, especially during the daylight tides. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 3 ft @ 12s, still workable at places like Croyde Beach and Saunton Sands, but overall a bit less punchy. By the day after, conditions fade to 1 ft @ 9s, making it more of a longboard day at the sheltered corners. Best: today.
