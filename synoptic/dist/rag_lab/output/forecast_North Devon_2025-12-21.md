North Devon is lighting up today with 4 ft @13s WSW swell and light ESE winds at 8 mph. Great options include Woolacombe and Putsborough, both working well from 08:18 to 16:11. Tomorrow sees a drop to 3 ft @12s, still fun at spots like Croyde Beach and Saunton Sands, but overall a bit weaker. By the day after, it fades further to 1 ft @9s, making it a quiet day across the coast. Best: today.
