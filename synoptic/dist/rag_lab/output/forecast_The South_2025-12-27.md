Today, the South is quiet with 3 ft @5s E swell, but fresh 22 mph ENE wind is making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 3 ft @6s ESE swell and 25 mph E wind, keeping it messy. By the day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @5s ESE with light 10 mph N wind, but it’s still not producing much. Best: day after.
