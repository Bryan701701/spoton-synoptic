Today, Saltburn Beach is offering some fun with 1 ft @ 4s SE and a moderate 13 mph SE wind. It's a workable option during the tide window from 08:14 to 15:38. Tomorrow, conditions drop slightly to 2 ft @ 4s SSW with fresh 23 mph SW winds, making it less appealing. The day after, Saltburn Beach returns to 1 ft @ 3s SW with light 10 mph SW winds, providing a better chance for some clean waves. Best: today.
