Today on the Causeway Coast, conditions are poor with 5 ft @8s W swell and fresh 11 mph SSE winds. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with the same swell height but a longer period of 11s and NW winds at 17 mph, making it workable at spots like White Park Bay. Day after, conditions drop back to poor with 5 ft @9s NW swell and stronger 21 mph SW winds. Best: tomorrow.
