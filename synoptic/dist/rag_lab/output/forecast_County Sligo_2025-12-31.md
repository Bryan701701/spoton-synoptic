Today in County Sligo, it's a quiet day with 2 ft @11s N swell, but the wind is on it at 5 mph S, making it a bit messy. Tomorrow sees a bump to 5 ft @8s NNW, but with fresh 20 mph NW winds, it’ll be blown out. The day after brings 7 ft @9s N, still with fresh 22 mph N winds, keeping conditions challenging. Best: today.
