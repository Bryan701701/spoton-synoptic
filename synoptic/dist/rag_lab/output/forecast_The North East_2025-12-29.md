Today, the North East is showing some fun 3 ft @ 9s NNE swell with fresh 17 mph N winds. Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach are your best bets, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell builds slightly to 4 ft @ 8s with moderate 15 mph NNE winds, making it a solid day for the same spots. By the day after, expect 4 ft @ 10s NNE with a shift to 17 mph W winds, offering cleaner conditions at Saltburn and Redcar. Best: tomorrow.
