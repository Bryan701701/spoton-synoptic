Today, the North East is looking fun with 3 ft @9s NNE swell and fresh 17 mph N winds. Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach are your best bets, especially around their tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell builds slightly to 4 ft @8s NNE, still with moderate NNE winds, making for a solid day at spots like Redcar and Coatham Sands. On the day after, expect similar conditions with 4 ft @10s NNE swell and a shift to 17 mph W winds, keeping it clean at Saltburn and Hartlepool. Best: tomorrow.
