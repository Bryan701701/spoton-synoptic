The North East is looking solid over the next few days! Today, expect 3 ft @ 9s NNE swell with fresh 17 mph N winds. Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach are your best bets, especially around their tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 4 ft @ 8s NNE with slightly lighter 15 mph NNE winds, keeping it fun at spots like Redcar and Coatham Sands. By the day after, the swell remains at 4 ft but with a longer period of 10s, and W winds will create cleaner conditions—great for Saltburn again. Best: day after.
