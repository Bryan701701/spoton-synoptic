Today on the Causeway Coast, it’s a bit rough with 7 ft @12s WNW swell and fresh 27 mph SW winds making it blown out; best to give it a miss. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 5 ft @10s WNW swell and 13 mph SSE winds, but still not producing much—only White Park Bay and Portballintrae showing some potential. By the day after, we see a nice boost with 5 ft @15s WNW swell and lighter 11 mph E winds, making for cleaner conditions at White Park Bay and Portballintrae. Best: day after.
