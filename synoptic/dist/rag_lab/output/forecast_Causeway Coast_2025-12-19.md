Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking poor with 7 ft @12s WNW swell and fresh 27 mph SW winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 5 ft @10s WNW swell and lighter 13 mph SSE winds, but still not producing much. By the day after, the surf holds at 5 ft @15s WNW with a gentle 11 mph E wind, offering some cleaner options at spots like White Park Bay and Portballintrae. Best: day after.
