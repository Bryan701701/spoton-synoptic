Today on the Dingle Peninsula, we've got solid surf at 10 ft @ 11s WNW with fresh 17 mph WNW winds. Ballybunion Left and Garywilliam Point are your best bets, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 7 ft @ 8s SW with 22 mph S winds, making for poor surf across the board. Day after, still poor with 10 ft @ 10s WSW and strong 31 mph SW winds. Best: today.
