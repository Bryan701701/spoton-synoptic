Today on the Dingle Peninsula, we’re seeing solid surf at 10 ft @ 11s WNW with fresh 17 mph WNW winds. Ballybunion Left and Garywilliam Point are your best bets, especially between 14:51–16:41. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 7 ft @ 8s SW with stronger 22 mph S winds, making it a poor day for surf. The day after, we’re looking at 10 ft @ 10s WSW, but with a strong 31 mph SW wind, it’ll be blown out. Best: today.
