Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it's looking solid with 10 ft @ 11s WNW swell and fresh 17 mph WNW winds. Ballybunion Left and Garywilliam Point are your best bets, especially around the tides from 14:51 to 16:41. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 7 ft @ 8s SW with fresh 22 mph S winds, making it poor across the board. The day after, expect similar poor conditions with 10 ft @ 10s WSW and strong 31 mph SW winds. Best: today.
