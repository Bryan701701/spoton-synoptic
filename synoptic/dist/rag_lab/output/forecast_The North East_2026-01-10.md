Today is looking solid in the North East with 5 ft @ 8s ENE swell and light 11 mph N winds. Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach are both prime spots, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @ 6s with fresh 31 mph S winds, making it a poor day for surfing. The day after continues the trend with 2 ft @ 6s SE swell and 21 mph SSW winds, keeping it flat. Best: today.
