Today is quiet across the North East with 4 ft @ 6s E swell, but fresh 18 mph E wind has it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 3 ft @ 6s E with moderate 12 mph ESE winds; sheltered spots like South Shields and Hartlepool may offer some fun. Day after, similar 3 ft @ 6s E continues with lighter 9 mph ESE winds, making it a bit more workable. Best: day after.
