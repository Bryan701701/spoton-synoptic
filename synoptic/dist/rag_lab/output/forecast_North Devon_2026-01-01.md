Today in North Devon, it’s looking pretty poor with 2 ft @5s WNW swell and fresh 23 mph WNW winds. Tomorrow sees a slight bump to 3 ft @5s NW, but the wind remains fresh at 19 mph, keeping it messy. Day after stays at 3 ft @5s NNW with similar wind conditions, so expect continued choppy surf. Best: tomorrow.
