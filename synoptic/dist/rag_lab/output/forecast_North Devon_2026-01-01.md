Today in North Devon, it's a bit of a struggle with 2 ft @5s WNW swell and fresh 23 mph WNW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight bump to 3 ft @5s NW, but the wind remains fresh at 19 mph, keeping conditions poor. Day after also holds at 3 ft @5s NNW with similar wind conditions. Best: tomorrow.
