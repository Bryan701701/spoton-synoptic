Today in Caithness, surf is looking fun with 3 ft @ 8s ESE swell and light SSW winds at 9 mph. Good spots like Ackergill and Sinclair's Bay are working well, especially during the daylight hours. Tomorrow, expect a bump to 5 ft @ 10s W with light SSW winds, making for some solid conditions at Point of Ness and Murkle Point. On the day after, surf holds at 4 ft @ 10s WNW but with fresh SSE winds, so best to stick to the sheltered corners. Best: tomorrow.
