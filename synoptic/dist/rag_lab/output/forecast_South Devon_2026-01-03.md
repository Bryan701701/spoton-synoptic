Today in South Devon, it's a quiet scene with 1 ft @9s SW swell and fresh 16 mph NNW wind, not producing any workable waves. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 1 ft @8s SW and lighter 8 mph NNW winds, still not offering much. Day after, the swell drops further to 1 ft @6s SW with light 6 mph NW winds, keeping it flat. Best: none.
