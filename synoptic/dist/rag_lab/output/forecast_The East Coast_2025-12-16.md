Today on the East Coast, it's a bit quiet with 2 ft @6s SSE and fresh 7 mph WSW winds, so give it a miss. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 3 ft @5s S at spots like Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay, but the wind at 14 mph SSW will keep it choppy. The day after looks promising with similar swell but lighter winds at 10 mph SSW, making it more workable at the same spots. Best: day after.
