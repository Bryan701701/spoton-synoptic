Today on the East Coast, it's a quiet one with 2 ft @6s SSE and fresh 7 mph WSW wind; not much happening. Tomorrow sees a slight uptick to 3 ft @5s S, but still not producing well with 14 mph SSW wind; sheltered spots like Aberdeen Beach may offer some fun. Day after brings similar conditions with 3 ft @5s S and 10 mph SSW wind, but improving slightly for those looking to paddle out. Best: day after.
