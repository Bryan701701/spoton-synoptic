Today in County Clare, surf is on the smaller side at 2 ft @ 6s, but fresh 18 mph WNW winds are making it messy across the board. Tomorrow sees a slight bump to 3 ft @ 6s, but the fresh 19 mph NW winds will keep conditions choppy. The day after drops back to 2 ft @ 6s with 17 mph N winds, still not ideal. Best: tomorrow.
