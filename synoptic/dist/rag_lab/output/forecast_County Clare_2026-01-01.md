Today in County Clare, surf is small and blown out at 2 ft @6s with fresh 18 mph WNW winds. Tomorrow sees a slight increase to 3 ft @6s, but the fresh NW wind continues to make it messy. By the day after, conditions remain similar with 2 ft @6s and 17 mph N winds, keeping it on the poor side. Best: tomorrow.
