Today in Northwest Wales, it's a fun day with clean 2 ft @8s WSW swell and light SE winds at 8 mph. Best spots include Porth Oer and Hells Mouth, both offering good windows early and mid-day. Tomorrow, conditions shift with a hefty 7 ft @10s WSW swell but strong 21 mph SW winds will make it blown out across the region. On the day after, expect a drop to 3 ft @10s WSW with light ESE winds, making for a much cleaner surf day. Best: today.
