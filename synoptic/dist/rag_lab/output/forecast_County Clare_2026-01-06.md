Today in County Clare, it's a quiet day with 2 ft @5s W swell and fresh 12 mph SSW wind. No good spots are showing, so it might be best to give it a miss. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 4 ft @8s WNW swell and 15 mph NW wind, making for some workable waves at spots like Doolin Point and Lahinch Beach. The day after looks even better, with 4 ft @9s WNW swell and light 4 mph SE wind, perfect for catching some fun waves. Best: day after.
