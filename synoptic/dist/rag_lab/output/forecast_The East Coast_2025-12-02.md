The East Coast is lighting up today with solid surf at 4 ft @ 7s SE and a moderate 11 mph WSW wind. Best spots include Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay, both offering fun waves during the tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @ 6s SSE with fresh 25 mph S winds, making it poor across the board. Day after, still 3 ft @ 5s SSE, but winds ease to 15 mph S, bringing some workable options at Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay. Best: today.
