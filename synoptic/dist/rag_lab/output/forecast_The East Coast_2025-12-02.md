Today on the East Coast, it's looking solid with 4 ft @ 7s SE swell and a light 11 mph WSW wind. Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay are both firing, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @ 6s with fresh 25 mph S winds, making it poor across the board. Day after, still 3 ft @ 5s but with lighter 15 mph S winds; a bit of a step up from tomorrow. Best: today.
