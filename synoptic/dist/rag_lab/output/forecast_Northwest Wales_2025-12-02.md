Northwest Wales is looking solid today with 4 ft @ 7s WSW swell and fresh 11 mph SW winds. Porth Oer and Hells Mouth (beach) are your top picks, especially around their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 8s, but conditions remain fun with light 8 mph SSE winds. Day after, expect similar 3 ft @ 8s with moderate 11 mph SW winds. Best: today.
