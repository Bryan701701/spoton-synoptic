Today in North Devon, it's a bit of a bummer with 4 ft @8s WSW swell and fresh 19 mph SW wind making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a bump to 6 ft @10s, but the strong 25 mph S wind will keep it messy. Day after, conditions improve slightly with 5 ft @10s WSW and 17 mph SSW wind, making it workable at sheltered spots like Croyde. Best: day after.
