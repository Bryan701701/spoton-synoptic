Today in North Devon, it's a bit of a struggle with 4 ft @8s WSW swell and fresh 19 mph SW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a bump to 6 ft @10s, but with stronger 25 mph S winds, it’ll still be challenging. Day after brings 5 ft @10s WSW with 17 mph SSW winds, offering a better chance for some fun. Best: day after.
