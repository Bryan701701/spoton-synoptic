Today in South Devon, conditions are poor with 3 ft @6s E swell and fresh 22 mph NE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 2 ft @6s ESE, still with fresh 21 mph ENE winds, keeping it messy. By the day after, the swell drops further to 1 ft @5s WSW with light 3 mph N winds, resulting in flat conditions. Best: today.
