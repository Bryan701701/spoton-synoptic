Today in South Devon, it's looking poor with 3 ft @6s E swell but fresh 22 mph NE wind making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @6s ESE with similar 21 mph ENE winds, keeping conditions messy. By the day after, we're down to 1 ft @5s WSW with light 3 mph N winds, so it's not producing. Best: today.
