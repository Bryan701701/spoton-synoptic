Today in Donegal, it's looking great with 5 ft @10s WNW swell and light 4 mph NNW winds. Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are prime spots, offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 6 ft @12s with light NW winds, making it a solid day for surf at places like Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand. On the day after, expect a drop to 3 ft @6s with fresh SSE winds, which will make conditions poor across the board. Best: tomorrow.
