Today in Donegal, it's a great day for surfing with clean 5 ft @10s WNW swell and light 4 mph NNW winds. Spots like Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are firing, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, expect a solid increase to 6 ft @12s with light winds, but watch for some onshore chop at the more exposed beaches. The day after, conditions drop with 5 ft @7s and fresh SSE winds, making it less favorable. Best: today.
