Today in Donegal, it's a bit rough with 12 ft @13s W swell and fresh 20 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions remain poor with 10 ft @12s W swell and 25 mph W winds, still not looking good. By the day after, the swell drops to 6 ft @10s W, but the wind eases to 17 mph WNW, offering some workable options at spots like Magheroaty Beach and Bloody Foreland. Best: day after.
