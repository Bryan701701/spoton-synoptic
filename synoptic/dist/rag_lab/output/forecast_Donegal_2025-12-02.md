Today in Donegal, conditions are poor with 12 ft @13s W swell and fresh 20 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 10 ft @12s W, but winds pick up to 25 mph, keeping it messy. By the day after, the swell drops to 6 ft @10s W, and while it improves slightly, it remains challenging with fresh winds. Best: day after.
