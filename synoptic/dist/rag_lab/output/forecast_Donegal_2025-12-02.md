Today in Donegal, it’s a bit of a struggle with poor conditions—swell at 12 ft @ 13s from the W and fresh 20 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions remain challenging with a swell of 10 ft @ 12s W and winds picking up to 25 mph, still not ideal. The day after, we see a slight improvement with 6 ft @ 10s W, but it's still on the lower end of the scale and not producing much. Best: day after.
