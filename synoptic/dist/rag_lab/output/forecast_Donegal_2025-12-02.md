Today in Donegal, it's a quiet one with no surf action, as the swell isn't hitting this coast. Tomorrow, conditions remain poor with 10 ft @12s W and fresh 25 mph W winds, making it blown out across the board. The day after, things improve slightly with 6 ft @10s W, but still not ideal, especially with fresh winds. Best: day after.
