Today in North Devon, surf is looking good with 4 ft @ 8s WSW and a fresh 14 mph S wind. Check out spots like Porlock Weir and Woolacombe, which are both working well. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 5 ft @ 9s WSW with the same fresh S wind, making it poor across the board. Day after, surf settles to 3 ft @ 11s W, with lighter 11 mph N winds, offering a cleaner session at spots like Woolacombe and Putsborough. Best: today.
