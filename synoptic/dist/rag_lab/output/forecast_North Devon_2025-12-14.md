North Devon is looking solid today with 4 ft @ 8s WSW swell and a moderate 14 mph S wind. Best spots include Porlock Weir and Lynmouth, both offering fun waves throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 5 ft @ 9s WSW with fresh 19 mph S winds, making it poor across the board. Day after, it cleans up a bit with 3 ft @ 11s W and lighter 11 mph N winds, especially at Woolacombe and Putsborough. Best: today.
