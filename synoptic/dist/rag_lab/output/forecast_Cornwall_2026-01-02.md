Today, Cornwall is experiencing poor conditions with 3 ft @ 5s NNW swell across the North, but fresh 24 mph NW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight increase to 4 ft @ 6s NNW, but the wind remains strong at 24 mph NNW, keeping it messy. By the day after, conditions drop to 2 ft @ 6s NNW with lighter winds at 18 mph NNW, but still not producing much. Best: day after.
