Today, North Yorks is seeing 3 ft @7s NNW with fresh 20 mph WNW winds; it’s a bit blown out, so best to give it a miss. Tomorrow, the swell increases to 7 ft @10s N but with strong 33 mph WNW winds, making it messy and challenging. The day after, expect 9 ft @9s N with 25 mph NW winds, still not ideal for clean surf. Best: none.
