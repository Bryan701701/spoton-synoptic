Today in North Yorks, it's a fun 2 ft @ 4s ENE with fresh 15 mph NE winds. Withernsea and Filey are your best bets, both offering clean conditions during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, expect a bump to 3 ft @ 7s NE, still holding that NE wind, making for a solid day at multiple spots. Day after, conditions improve further with 3 ft @ 8s NNE and lighter winds, perfect for a surf session. Best: day after.
