Today in Gower, conditions are poor with 5 ft @6s WNW swell and fresh 29 mph NW winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow brings a nice improvement with 3 ft @7s WSW and moderate 11 mph WNW winds, making spots like Llangennith Beach and Caswell Bay workable during the tide windows. Day after, expect 6 ft @8s W but with fresh 23 mph NW winds, leading to another blown-out day. Best: tomorrow.
