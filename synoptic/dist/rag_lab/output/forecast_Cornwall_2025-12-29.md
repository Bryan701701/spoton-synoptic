Today in Cornwall, it's a quiet day with no surf action—swell isn’t hitting this coast and the wind's not helping. Tomorrow, Bude offers some fun with 2 ft @9s NW and light NE winds, making it the best pick of the day. Day after, conditions improve slightly with 1 ft @12s W at several spots, but still not much to ride. Best: tomorrow.
