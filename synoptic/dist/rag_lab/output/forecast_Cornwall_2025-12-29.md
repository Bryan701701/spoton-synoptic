Today, surf is quiet across Cornwall with no significant swell hitting the coast. Tomorrow, Bude shows some promise with 2 ft @9s NW and light NE winds, but overall conditions remain poor on the North and South coasts. By the day after, the West coast has a slight improvement with 2 ft @12s W, but still not ideal. Best: tomorrow.
