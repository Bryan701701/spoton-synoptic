Today in Sutherland, it's a no-go with 9 ft @8s SW swell and fresh 44 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow brings a solid 7 ft @11s NW swell with 25 mph WSW winds, so look for sheltered spots like Sango Bay to work well during the tide push. The day after, Sango Bay remains the top pick with 7 ft @8s WNW swell and 27 mph W winds, still offering some fun. Best: tomorrow.
