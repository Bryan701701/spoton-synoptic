Today in Sutherland, conditions are poor with a hefty 9 ft @ 8s SW swell and fresh 44 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees an improvement with 7 ft @ 11s NW swell and 25 mph WSW winds, offering some clean options at spots like Sango Bay and Strathy during the mid-tide push. The day after, Sango Bay remains the standout with 7 ft @ 8s WNW and 27 mph W winds, still providing some fun waves. Best: tomorrow.
