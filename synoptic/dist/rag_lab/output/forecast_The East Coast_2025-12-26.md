The East Coast is looking fun today with 1 ft @ 6s ESE swell and light 4 mph W winds. St Andrews West and Arbroath are your go-to spots, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 1 ft @ 5s ESE and a bit more wind at 11 mph NW, still workable at the same spots. Day after, we see a nice bump to 2 ft @ 7s NE with lighter winds, making it a great day to hit the waves. Best: day after.
