The East Coast is looking fun today with 1 ft @ 6s ESE swell and light 4 mph W winds. St Andrews West and Arbroath are the top picks, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 1 ft @ 5s ESE and moderate 11 mph NW winds, still workable at the same spots. By the day after, the swell picks up to 2 ft @ 7s NE, offering more fun with light 6 mph WNW winds. Best: day after.
