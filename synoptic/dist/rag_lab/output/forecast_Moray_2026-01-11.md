Today in Moray, conditions are poor with 3 ft @ 5s SE swell and fresh 36 mph SSE winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 3 ft @ 6s SSE swell and moderate 21 mph S winds, but still not producing much. By the day after, the swell picks up to 4 ft @ 6s WNW, and winds ease to 13 mph SW, offering a better chance for some fun waves. Best: day after.
