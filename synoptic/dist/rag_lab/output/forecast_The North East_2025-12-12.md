Today in the North East, it’s looking great with 3 ft @ 7s ESE swell and a light 12 mph S wind. Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands are both firing, with optimal tides from 08:17 to 15:37 and 08:18 to 15:37 respectively. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 1 ft @ 6s WNW with fresh 13 mph SW winds, so it’s best to give it a miss. Day after, a slight improvement to 2 ft @ 4s SSW at Saltburn Beach, but still on the weaker side with 18 mph SW winds. Best: today.
