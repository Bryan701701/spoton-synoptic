Today, Dingle Peninsula is quiet with no surf action—swell isn’t hitting this coast and the wind is fresh at 38 mph SSE. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with a hefty swell of 16 ft @14s WSW, but the fresh 35 mph WSW wind will keep it blown out. On the day after, things improve slightly to 7 ft @10s WSW with 18 mph W wind, making it workable at sheltered spots like Ballybunion. Best: day after.
