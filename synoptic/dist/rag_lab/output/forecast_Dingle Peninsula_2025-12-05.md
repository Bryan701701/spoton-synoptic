Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it's a flat day with no surf action—just calm conditions. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 16 ft @14s WSW, but fresh 35 mph WSW winds will make it blown out. On the day after, conditions improve slightly with 7 ft @10s WSW, and winds ease to 18 mph, making it workable at sheltered spots like Ballybunion. Best: day after.
