Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it’s flat with no surf action—wrong swell angle and light winds. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with 16 ft @14s WSW swell and fresh 35 mph WSW winds, leading to blown-out surf. Day after, we see a drop to 7 ft @10s WSW with 18 mph W winds; it’s workable at times, especially around the tide windows. Best: day after.
