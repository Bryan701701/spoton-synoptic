Today, the Dingle Peninsula is seeing poor conditions with swell at 11 ft @ 11 s from the W and fresh 38 mph SSE winds. Tomorrow, it gets a bit bigger with 16 ft @ 14 s WSW swell, but the strong 35 mph WSW winds will keep it messy. By the day after, conditions improve to 7 ft @ 10 s WSW with lighter 18 mph W winds, making it more workable at spots like Ballybunion. Best: day after.
