Today, Dingle Peninsula is quiet with no surf, as the swell isn't hitting this coast and the wind is fresh from the SSW at 29 mph. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with swell increasing to 11 ft @ 11s but still blown out by a strong 36 mph S wind. The day after remains similar with 11 ft @ 10s WSW swell and 30 mph W wind, keeping it messy. Best: today.
