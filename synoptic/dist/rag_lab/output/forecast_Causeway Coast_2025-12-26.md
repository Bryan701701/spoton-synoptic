Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking good with 2 ft @9s NNW swell and a light 13 mph E wind. White Park Bay and Portballintrae are your best bets, both working nicely from 08:52 to 16:00. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2 ft @6s NE with fresh 19 mph E winds, making it poor across the board. Day after, we see a slight improvement with 2 ft @8s NNW and light 7 mph ENE winds, offering a better chance at some fun waves. Best: today.
