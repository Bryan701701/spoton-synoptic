Today in Pembrokeshire, it's looking great with 4 ft @ 12s WSW swell and light 5 mph WNW winds. Spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are firing, especially during the mid-tide windows. Tomorrow, swell builds to 6 ft @ 12s WSW with fresh 16 mph SW winds, so expect some chop but still fun at sheltered corners. Day after, conditions drop to 5 ft @ 8s SW with strong 22 mph SSW winds, making it blown out across the board. Best: today.
