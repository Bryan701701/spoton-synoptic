Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a solid 4 ft @ 12s WSW with light 5 mph WNW winds. Great conditions at spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay, especially on the mid-tide push. Tomorrow, we see a bump to 6 ft @ 12s WSW, but winds pick up to 16 mph SW, making it a bit choppy. By the day after, conditions drop to 5 ft @ 8s SW with fresh 22 mph SSW winds, leading to blown-out surf. Best: today.
