Today in Pembrokeshire, it's looking great with 4 ft @ 12s WSW swell and light 5 mph WNW winds. Spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are clean and fun, especially during the mid-tide windows. Tomorrow, swell builds to 6 ft @ 12s WSW, but with fresh 16 mph SW winds, it may get a bit choppy. By the day after, conditions drop to 5 ft @ 8s SW with stronger winds, making it less inviting. Best: today.
