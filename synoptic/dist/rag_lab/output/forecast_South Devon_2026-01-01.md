Today in South Devon, it's a quiet scene with 1 ft @6s W swell and fresh 16 mph WNW wind, making conditions less than ideal. Tomorrow sees a similar setup with 1 ft @5s WNW swell and 14 mph NW wind, keeping it on the poor side. Day after brings a slight bump to 2 ft @7s W, but with light 5 mph NW wind, it may be the best chance for some fun waves. Best: day after.
