Today in South Devon, surf is small at 1 ft @6s with fresh 16 mph WNW wind, making it blown out and not producing. Tomorrow sees similar conditions with 1 ft @5s, still not workable due to 14 mph NW wind. Day after, we get a slight bump to 2 ft @7s with lighter 5 mph NW wind, offering a better chance for some fun waves. Best: day after.
