Today in Donegal, it's looking poor with 8ft @10s WSW swell but fresh 34 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow brings a significant improvement with 8ft @16s W swell and lighter 12 mph SSE winds, making it a great day for spots like Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand. The day after, conditions drop back to 12ft @13s W swell with fresh onshore winds, leading to messy surf. Best: tomorrow.
