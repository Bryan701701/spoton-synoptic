North Devon is looking solid today with 4 ft @ 13s W swell and light 9 mph S winds. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are both firing, with good windows to catch some fun waves. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @ 8s WSW, and winds pick up to 13 mph SSW, making it a bit choppy but still surfable at spots like Woolacombe and Croyde Beach. Day after, conditions decline with 5 ft @ 9s WSW swell and fresh 20 mph S winds, leading to blown-out surf. Best: today.
