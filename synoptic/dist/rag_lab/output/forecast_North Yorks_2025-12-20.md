Today is flat across North Yorks with no surf energy—just 1 ft @4s SSW and fresh 17 mph SSW winds. Tomorrow brings a nice bump to 2 ft @5s ESE with moderate 12 mph ESE winds, making it a good day for a paddle at spots like Withernsea and Filey. Day after, the swell increases to 4 ft @6s E with similar winds, providing more fun options. Best: tomorrow.
