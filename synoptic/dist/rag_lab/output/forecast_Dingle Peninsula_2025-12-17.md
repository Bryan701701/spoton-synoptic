Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it's looking poor with 10 ft @10s WSW swell and fresh 24 mph SW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell increases to 15 ft @15s, but the fresh 26 mph S winds will keep conditions messy. The day after, expect similar 15 ft @14s W swell with even stronger 29 mph W winds, continuing the trend of challenging surf. Best: none.
