North Devon is looking fun today with clean 3 ft @ 7s WNW swell and a moderate 12 mph NW wind. Woolacombe and Putsborough are your top picks, both working well throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 5 ft @ 7s WSW with fresh 19 mph SSW winds, making it poor across the board. Day after, we see a nice rebound with 4 ft @ 9s W swell and lighter 9 mph SSW winds, bringing back some good options. Best: today.
