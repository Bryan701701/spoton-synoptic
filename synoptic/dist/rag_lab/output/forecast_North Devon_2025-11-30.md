North Devon is looking fun today with 3 ft @ 7s WNW swell and a moderate 12 mph NW wind. Woolacombe and Putsborough are your best bets, both offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 5 ft @ 7s WSW with fresh 19 mph SSW winds, making it poor across the board. The day after, expect a nice comeback with 4 ft @ 9s W swell and lighter 9 mph SSW winds, perfect for a surf session. Best: today.
