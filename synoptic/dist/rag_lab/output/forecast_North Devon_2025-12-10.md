Today in North Devon, conditions are poor with 5 ft @10s WSW swell and fresh 19 mph SW winds. It's blown out across the board, so best to give it a miss. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 4 ft @10s WSW swell and moderate 14 mph S winds; still not ideal but workable at sheltered spots like Porlock Weir or Woolacombe during the tide windows. The day after looks promising with 4 ft @13s W swell and light 8 mph WNW winds, offering cleaner conditions at spots like Croyde Beach. Best: day after.
