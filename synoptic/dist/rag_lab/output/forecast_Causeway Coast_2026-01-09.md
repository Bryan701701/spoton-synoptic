Today on the Causeway Coast, White Park Bay and Portballintrae are lighting up with 4 ft @ 10s WNW swell and light 3 mph NW winds. Perfect conditions for a fun session, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 4 ft but picks up to 12s, with a light 7 mph SSE breeze, keeping it clean. Day after, expect poor conditions with 4 ft @ 6s S swell and fresh 34 mph SSE winds, making it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
