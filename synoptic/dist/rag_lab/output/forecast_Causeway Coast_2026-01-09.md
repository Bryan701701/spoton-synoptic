Today, the Causeway Coast is lighting up with 4 ft @10s WNW swell and light 3 mph NW winds. White Park Bay and Portballintrae are your best bets, especially on the push from 08:48 to 16:18. Tomorrow, expect similar conditions with a slightly longer period at 12s, keeping it fun and clean. However, by the day after, strong 34 mph SSE winds will blow out the surf, making it poor across the board. Best: today.
