Today in South Devon, conditions are poor with 4 ft @8s SW swell and fresh 25 mph WSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees an improvement with 6 ft @8s SW swell and lighter 12 mph SSW winds, offering a workable day at spots like Bovisand Reef and Bantham. Day after, the swell ramps up to 10 ft @9s SSW, but strong 33 mph SSW winds will likely make it challenging. Best: tomorrow.
