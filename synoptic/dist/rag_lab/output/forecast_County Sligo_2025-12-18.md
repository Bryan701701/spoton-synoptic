Today in County Sligo, we're looking at solid surf with 9 ft @ 17s WNW swell and light 12 mph SSE winds. Strandhill and Easkey Right are your best bets, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 9 ft @ 13s WNW swell but fresh 30 mph WSW winds will make it blown out. On the day after, the swell decreases to 5 ft @ 10s WNW with 27 mph SSE winds, keeping it poor across the board. Best: today.
