Today in County Sligo, it's a bit rough with 5 ft @9s WSW swell and fresh 26 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees an increase to 7 ft @15s WNW, but the fresh S wind continues, keeping conditions poor. On the day after, the swell peaks at 8 ft @14s WNW with similar wind, but some spots like Strandhill and Easkey Right may offer a workable window. Best: day after.
