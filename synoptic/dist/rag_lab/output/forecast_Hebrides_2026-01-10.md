Today in the Hebrides, it's a no-go with 6 ft @11s WSW swell and fresh 30 mph SSE winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with 8 ft @7s SSW swell and 42 mph onshore, making it messy and unworkable. The day after brings even bigger surf at 11 ft @10s SW, but with strong 57 mph SSW winds, it’s still not looking good. Best: none.
