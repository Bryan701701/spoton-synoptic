Today in North Devon, it’s looking pretty flat with 1 ft @ 5s ENE and fresh 11 mph ESE winds. Tomorrow sees a slight bump to 2 ft @ 5s, but still with light E winds, so it’s not really firing. The day after, conditions remain similar with 2 ft @ 5s, but winds pick up to 17 mph E, making it a bit choppy. Best: tomorrow.
