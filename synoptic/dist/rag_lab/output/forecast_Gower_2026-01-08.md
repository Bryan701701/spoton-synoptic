Today in Gower, surf is looking fun with 4 ft @ 7s W and a moderate 12 mph WNW wind. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are your best bets, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 5 ft @ 8s W but the fresh 27 mph NW wind will make it blown out across the board. On the day after, expect a solid 5 ft @ 10s W with light 8 mph NW winds, making for clean surf at spots like Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach. Best: day after.
