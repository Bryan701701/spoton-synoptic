Today in Donegal, it’s looking good with clean 3 ft @ 8s WNW at spots like Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand, thanks to light 2 mph S winds. Perfect for a fun session on the push! Tomorrow, conditions shift with the swell still at 3 ft but winds picking up to 16 mph S, making it a bit choppy. On the day after, the swell increases to 8 ft @ 12s, but fresh SSW winds will create some challenging conditions. Best: today.
