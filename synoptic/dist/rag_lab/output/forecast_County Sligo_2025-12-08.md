Today in County Sligo, it's a bit of a struggle with 3 ft @9s WSW swell and fresh 12 mph SSW winds creating a blown-out scene. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 3 ft @11s WNW swell, but the 17 mph ESE winds will still keep it choppy, with Strandhill and Easkey Left being the better spots. On the day after, the swell picks up to 6 ft @9s WNW, but strong 25 mph SW winds will make it messy. Best: tomorrow.
