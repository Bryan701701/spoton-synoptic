Today in County Sligo, it's a bit of a struggle with 3 ft @9s WSW swell and fresh 12 mph SSW winds. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 3 ft @11s WNW swell, but the 17 mph ESE winds will keep things choppy; sheltered spots like Strandhill and Easkey Left may offer some fun. Day after, expect 6 ft @9s WNW swell with strong 25 mph SW winds, making it quite blown out. Best: tomorrow.
