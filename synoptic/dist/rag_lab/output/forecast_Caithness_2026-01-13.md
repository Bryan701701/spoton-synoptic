Today in Caithness, surf is looking good with 3ft @8s ESE at Ackergill and Sinclair's Bay, both with a light WSW wind at 11 mph. Best times are 10:17–12:07 for Ackergill and 08:52–15:50 for Sinclair's Bay. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 6ft @8s WNW at several spots like Point of Ness and Murkle Point, but wind picks up to 12 mph SW, making it a bit choppy. The day after, surf remains at 3ft @6s SE across the board, but with stronger winds at 21 mph SSW, making it less appealing. Best: today.
