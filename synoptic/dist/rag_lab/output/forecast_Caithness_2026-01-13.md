Today in Caithness, surf is looking good with 3ft @8s ESE at spots like Ackergill and Sinclair's Bay, both working well under a moderate 11 mph WSW wind. Tomorrow, conditions shift with 6ft @8s WNW at several spots, including Point of Ness and Murkle Point, but expect a fresh 12 mph SW wind to create some chop. On the day after, it drops to 3ft @6s SE with a stronger 21 mph SSW wind, likely making it blown out. Best: today.
