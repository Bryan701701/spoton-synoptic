Today in North Devon, it's looking poor with 3 ft @5s ENE swell and fresh 36 mph ENE winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 2 ft @4s, still with fresh 30 mph ENE winds, keeping it messy. On the day after, conditions remain similar with 2 ft @5s and easing winds at 9 mph E, but no significant improvement. Best: day after.
