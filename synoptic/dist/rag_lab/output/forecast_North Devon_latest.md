North Devon is lighting up today with 4 ft @ 11s W swell and light 11 mph SSE winds. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are great picks, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 8 ft @ 11s W with fresh 29 mph WSW winds, making it blown out across the coast. On the day after, expect 5 ft @ 11s WSW with 14 mph SE winds; still workable at spots like Woolacombe and Putsborough. Best: today.
