North Devon is lighting up today with 5 ft @9s WSW swell and fresh 17 mph S winds. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are great picks, with good windows to score some fun waves. Tomorrow, conditions clean up with 3 ft @12s W swell and lighter 10 mph NNW winds, making it a solid day at spots like Woolacombe and Putsborough. On the day after, expect similar 3 ft @9s WSW swell but with fresh S winds, keeping it workable at sheltered corners. Best: tomorrow.
