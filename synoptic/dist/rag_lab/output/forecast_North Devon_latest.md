Today in North Devon, it's looking great with 4 ft @ 8s W swell and light SSW winds at 11 mph. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are solid picks, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 4 ft but shifts to a longer 12s period with ESE winds at 9 mph, making for clean conditions across the board. On the day after, conditions drop slightly to 4 ft @ 9s W with fresh WSW winds at 17 mph, so look for sheltered spots like Croyde. Best: tomorrow.
