North Devon is looking solid today with 5 ft @ 8s WSW swell and fresh 18 mph SSW winds. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are your best bets, with workable conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 10s, but with light 7 mph SE winds, it should be fun at spots like Woolacombe and Putsborough. Day after, conditions remain good with 3 ft @ 8s W, light winds, and plenty of options at Croyde Beach and Saunton Sands. Best: today.
