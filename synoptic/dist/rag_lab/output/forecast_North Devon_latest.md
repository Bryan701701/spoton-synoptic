Today in North Devon, it's a bit rough with 5 ft @7s NW swell and fresh 23 mph NW wind. All spots are blown out, so it’s best to find shelter or give it a miss. Tomorrow sees similar conditions with 5 ft @9s W swell and 25 mph NW wind, still not producing anything clean. The day after drops to 2 ft @7s SW with 23 mph SSE wind, remaining poor across the board. Best: none.
