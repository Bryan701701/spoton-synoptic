North Devon is looking solid today with 3 ft @10s WSW swell and light SSE winds. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are both firing, offering fun waves throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @10s, still workable at spots like Woolacombe and Putsborough, but it may feel a bit quieter. By the day after, we see a return to 3 ft @9s W swell, with Croyde Beach and Woolacombe holding up nicely. Best: today.
