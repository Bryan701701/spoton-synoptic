Today in North Devon, it's looking good with 3 ft @6s WNW swell and moderate 11 mph WNW winds. Woolacombe and Putsborough are prime spots, especially on the push from 08:19 to 16:28. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 5 ft @7s NW swell and fresh 26 mph NW winds, making it blown out across the board. Day after, the swell eases to 4 ft @9s with lighter 13 mph NNW winds, offering some workable options at spots like Woolacombe and Croyde. Best: today.
