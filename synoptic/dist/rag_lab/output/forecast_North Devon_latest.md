Today in North Devon, it’s looking solid with 4 ft @10s W swell and a moderate 13 mph NW wind. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are great picks, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @6s SW with fresh 26 mph SSE winds, making it a poor day for surf. The day after, we see a slight increase to 6 ft @9s WSW, but with 22 mph SW winds, it’ll be blown out. Best: today.
