Today in North Devon, it’s looking pretty quiet with 1 ft @ 7s NE and fresh 24 mph ENE winds across the board. Tomorrow sees a slight bump to 2 ft @ 7s ENE, but still with moderate 12 mph winds, so expect some chop. Day after drops back to 1 ft @ 12s W with light 3 mph winds, making it a bit more manageable. Best: tomorrow.
