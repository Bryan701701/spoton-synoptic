North Devon is looking a bit flat today with 3 ft @6s ENE swell, but fresh 13 mph ENE winds are making it messy across the board. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 3 ft @5s with stronger 21 mph NE winds, keeping conditions poor. Day after, we see even smaller waves at 2 ft @4s, still with 16 mph ENE winds, so not much improvement. Best: today.
