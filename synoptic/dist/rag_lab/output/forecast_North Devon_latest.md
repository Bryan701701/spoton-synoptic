North Devon is looking solid today with 4 ft @10s WSW swell and light ESE winds at 12 mph. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are both great options, especially with Lynmouth's tide peaking from 08:17 to 16:08. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 4 ft but with a longer period of 13s, making it even better—ideal for all the good spots. By the day after, the swell drops to 3 ft, but still workable at Woolacombe and Putsborough. Best: tomorrow.
