North Devon is looking great today with 4 ft @ 13s W swell and light 9 mph S winds. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are prime spots, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop a bit to 4 ft @ 8s WSW with fresh 13 mph SSW winds, still workable at the same locations. By the day after, we see a further increase to 5 ft @ 9s WSW, but the fresh wind will make it blown out. Best: today.
