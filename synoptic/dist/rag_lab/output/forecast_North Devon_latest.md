North Devon is looking solid today with 5 ft @ 14s W swell and light 8 mph S winds. Great options include Porlock Weir and Lynmouth, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 7 ft @ 11s W swell but fresh 31 mph WSW winds will make it blown out. Day after, it eases to 4 ft @ 9s WSW with 17 mph SSE winds, still workable at spots like Woolacombe. Best: today.
