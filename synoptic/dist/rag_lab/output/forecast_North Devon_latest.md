North Devon is lighting up today with 7 ft @10s W swell and fresh 17 mph WSW winds. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are solid options, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow sees a drop to 4 ft @10s WSW, with lighter 13 mph ESE winds, still workable at spots like Woolacombe and Putsborough. Day after brings cleaner conditions with 4 ft @13s W and light 5 mph SE winds, perfect for a fun session at Croyde Beach or Saunton Sands. Best: today.
