Today in North Devon, there's some small surf at 1 ft @ 4s with a moderate 12 mph NW wind. Woolacombe and Putsborough are your best bets, with clean conditions early on. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 4 ft @ 6s, but fresh 27 mph NW winds will make it blown out and poor across the region. Day after, conditions improve with 2 ft @ 6s and light 6 mph W winds, making for a fun day at spots like Woolacombe and Putsborough. Best: day after.
