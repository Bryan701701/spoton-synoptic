North Devon is looking solid today with 4 ft @ 8s W swell and light SSW winds at 11 mph. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are both firing, with great conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 4 ft but increases to 12s, and winds shift to a light ESE, making it even cleaner—ideal for a surf session! Day after, the wind picks up to 17 mph WSW, creating some chop, but still 4 ft surf across the board. Best: tomorrow.
