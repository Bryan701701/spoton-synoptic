Today in North Devon, it's a bit of a struggle with 2 ft @ 5s NW swell and fresh 21 mph NNE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 2 ft @ 5s WNW and lighter 13 mph NNW winds, so sheltered spots like Woolacombe and Croyde Beach could be workable. Day after, the swell picks up to 4 ft @ 6s WNW, but with fresh 21 mph NNW winds, it may still be challenging. Best: tomorrow.
