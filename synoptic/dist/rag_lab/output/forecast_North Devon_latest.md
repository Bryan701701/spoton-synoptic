Today in North Devon, it's looking poor with 3 ft @5s NW swell and fresh 26 mph NNW winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 2 ft @4s NW with moderate 13 mph NW winds, still not producing much. Day after remains similar at 2 ft @4s NW and light 12 mph N winds, keeping conditions lackluster. Best: tomorrow.
