Today in North Devon, it's looking great with 4 ft @ 11s W swell and light SSE winds at 11 mph. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are both solid options, especially with the tide at Lynmouth peaking from 09:03 to 17:08. Tomorrow, conditions drop as the swell increases to 8 ft @ 11s W but is blown out by fresh 29 mph WSW winds, making it poor for surfing. Day after, the swell settles back to 5 ft @ 11s WSW with moderate SE winds at 14 mph, offering some workable waves. Best: today.
