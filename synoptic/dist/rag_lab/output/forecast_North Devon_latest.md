Today in North Devon, it's a quiet start with 1 ft @12s W across all spots, and light SE winds. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 2 ft @5s WNW, but the fresh 16 mph WNW wind will create some chop. The day after brings 3 ft @5s WNW, but with stronger 24 mph NW winds, it’ll be blown out. Best: tomorrow.
