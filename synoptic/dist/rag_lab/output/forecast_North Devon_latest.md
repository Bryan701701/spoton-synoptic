North Devon is looking solid today with 4 ft @10s W swell and light NNW winds at 10 mph. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are both good options, with the best tides for Porlock from 11:23 to 13:13. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @8s WNW with moderate NW winds at 12 mph, still workable at spots like Woolacombe and Putsborough. Day after, expect 4 ft @7s SW with fresh SSW winds at 24 mph, likely blown out across the board. Best: today.
