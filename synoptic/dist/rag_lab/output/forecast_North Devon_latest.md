Today in North Devon, conditions are poor with 4 ft @ 7s W swell and fresh 20 mph NW winds creating a blown-out scene. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 4 ft but with a longer period of 11s and lighter 17 mph S winds, making it more workable, especially at spots like Woolacombe and Croyde Beach. Day after, expect a significant increase to 9 ft @ 10s WSW but with strong 32 mph WSW winds, making it challenging. Best: tomorrow.
