North Devon is looking solid today with 4 ft @10s WSW swell and light ESE winds at 12 mph. Great spots like Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are firing, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 4 ft but increases to 13s, with lighter winds at 9 mph, keeping the conditions clean and fun. By the day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @12s, still workable at spots like Woolacombe and Putsborough, but not as punchy. Best: tomorrow.
