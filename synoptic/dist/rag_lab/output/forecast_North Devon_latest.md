North Devon is looking fun today with 2 ft @10s WSW swell and light 6 mph SSE winds. Woolacombe and Putsborough are your best bets, both working nicely throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 3 ft @8s with a moderate 12 mph WSW wind, keeping spots like Croyde Beach and Saunton Sands lively. Day after, expect 4 ft @10s with similar winds, making for solid surf at all the usual spots. Best: day after.
