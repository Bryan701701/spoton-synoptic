Today in North Devon, it's a bit of a struggle with 2 ft @5s NW swell and fresh 21 mph NNE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with similar 2 ft @5s WNW swell but lighter 13 mph NNW winds, making it more workable at spots like Woolacombe and Croyde Beach. The day after brings a bump to 4 ft @6s WNW, but fresh 21 mph NNW winds will still keep it messy. Best: tomorrow.
