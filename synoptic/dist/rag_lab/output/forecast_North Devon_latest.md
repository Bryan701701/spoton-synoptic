North Devon is lighting up today with solid 4 ft @ 11s W swell and light SSE winds at 11 mph. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are both good options, with Lynmouth best from 08:03–16:08. Tomorrow, conditions take a turn for the worse with 8 ft @ 11s W swell and fresh 29 mph WSW winds, making it blown out across the region. By the day after, we see a drop to 5 ft @ 11s WSW with more manageable 14 mph SE winds, making it workable at spots like Woolacombe and Croyde Beach. Best: today.
