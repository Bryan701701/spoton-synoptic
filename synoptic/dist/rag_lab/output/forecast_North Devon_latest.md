North Devon is lighting up today with clean 4 ft @ 13s W swell and light S winds at 9 mph. Great options at Porlock Weir and Lynmouth, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop slightly to 4 ft @ 8s WSW with fresh SSW winds at 13 mph, still workable but a bit choppy. By the day after, expect 5 ft @ 9s WSW with stronger 20 mph S winds, making it poor across the board. Best: today.
