Today in North Devon, conditions are poor with 3 ft @5s ENE swell, but fresh 36 mph ENE winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 2 ft @4s, still with fresh 30 mph ENE winds, keeping it messy. The day after remains similar with 2 ft @5s and easing winds at 9 mph E, offering a chance for some cleaner, albeit small, surf. Best: day after.
