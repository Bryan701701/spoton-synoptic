Today in North Devon, it’s a bit of a bummer with 2 ft @5s NW swell and fresh 21 mph NNE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 2 ft @5s WNW swell and lighter 13 mph NNW winds, so sheltered spots like Woolacombe and Putsborough should be workable. The day after brings 4 ft @6s WNW swell, but fresh 21 mph NNW winds will likely keep things choppy. Best: tomorrow.
