Today in North Devon, there are small but workable waves at 1 ft @ 4s from the WNW, with a moderate 12 mph NW wind. Woolacombe and Putsborough are your best bets, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 4 ft @ 6s but will be blown out by fresh 27 mph NW winds, making it less appealing. Day after, conditions improve with 2 ft @ 6s and light 6 mph W winds, perfect for a fun session. Best: day after.
