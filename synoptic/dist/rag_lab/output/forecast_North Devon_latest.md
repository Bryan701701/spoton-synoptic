Today in North Devon, surf is small and clean at 1 ft @ 7s NNE with light 8 mph E winds. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 1 ft @ 12s W and light 3 mph SSE winds, still not producing much. Day after, we see a slight improvement with 2 ft @ 5s WNW, but winds pick up to 17 mph WNW, making it a bit choppy. Best: day after.
