North Devon is lighting up today with clean 4 ft @ 13s W swell and light S winds at 9 mph. Great options at Porlock Weir and Lynmouth, with prime tides to catch. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @ 8s WSW, but it's still workable with moderate SSW winds at 13 mph. By the day after, conditions worsen with 5 ft @ 9s WSW and fresh S winds at 20 mph, making it blown out. Best: today.
