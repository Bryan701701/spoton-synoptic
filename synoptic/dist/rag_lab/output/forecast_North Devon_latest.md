North Devon is looking solid today with 4 ft @ 8s WSW swell and fresh 14 mph S winds. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are great picks, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 5 ft @ 9s WSW with fresh 19 mph S winds, making it poor across the board. Day after brings 3 ft @ 11s W with lighter 11 mph N winds, offering cleaner options at spots like Woolacombe and Putsborough. Best: today.
