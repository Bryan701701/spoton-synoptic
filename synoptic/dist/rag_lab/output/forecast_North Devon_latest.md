Today in North Devon, surf is on with 3 ft @6s SW and fresh 17 mph SSE winds. Woolacombe and Putsborough are your best bets, with sheltered corners working nicely. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 5 ft @9s WSW but fresh 22 mph SSW winds will make it blown out across the board. Day after looks promising with cleaner 3 ft @10s W and light 8 mph S winds, perfect for a fun session at spots like Croyde Beach. Best: day after.
