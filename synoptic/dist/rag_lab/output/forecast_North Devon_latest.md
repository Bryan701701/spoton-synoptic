Today in North Devon is looking poor with 4 ft @6s NW swell, but fresh 30 mph NW winds are making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 3 ft @6s WNW swell and light 6 mph SSW winds, making for clean surf at spots like Woolacombe and Croyde Beach. The day after, the swell picks up to 6 ft @7s WNW, but fresh 26 mph NW winds will keep it messy. Best: tomorrow.
