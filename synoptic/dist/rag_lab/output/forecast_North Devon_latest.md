North Devon is lighting up today with 5 ft @9s WSW swell and fresh 17 mph S winds. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are great picks, with workable conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @12s, but it remains fun with light NNW winds, especially at Woolacombe and Putsborough. Day after, expect similar 3 ft @9s WSW with a fresh S breeze, keeping it surfable at spots like Croyde Beach. Best: today.
