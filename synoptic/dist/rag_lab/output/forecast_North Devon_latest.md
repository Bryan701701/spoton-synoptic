Today in North Devon, it's a flat day with no surf action—just calm waters. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 3 ft @ 6s WNW and light 6 mph SSW winds, making it a great day for a surf session at spots like Woolacombe or Croyde Beach. The day after, expect 6 ft @ 7s WNW, but fresh 26 mph NW winds will make it blown out and messy. Best: tomorrow.
