North Devon is looking good today with 3ft @6s WNW swell and a moderate 11 mph WNW wind. Woolacombe and Putsborough are prime spots, both working well throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 5ft @7s NW swell but fresh 26 mph NW winds will make it blown out and poor. On the day after, we see 4ft @9s W swell with lighter 13 mph NNW winds, making for a more manageable surf. Best: today.
