Today in North Devon, it’s a tough one with 8 ft @11s W swell and fresh 29 mph WSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 4 ft @12s W swell and moderate 14 mph SW winds; expect some workable corners at spots like Woolacombe and Croyde. Day after, the swell drops to 4 ft @8s WSW with fresh 21 mph SSW winds, keeping it poor across the board. Best: tomorrow.
