Today in North Devon, it's looking fun with 5 ft @8s WSW swell and fresh 18 mph SSW winds. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are your best bets, with good windows to catch some waves. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @10s WSW, but with light 7 mph SE winds, it should be clean and enjoyable across the board. Day after, similar 3 ft @8s W swell continues, but with even lighter 5 mph WSW winds, making for a great day at spots like Woolacombe and Putsborough. Best: tomorrow.
