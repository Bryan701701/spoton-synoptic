North Devon is lighting up today with solid 5 ft @ 14s W swell and light S winds at 8 mph. Great options include Porlock Weir and Lynmouth, both offering fun waves, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions take a turn with 7 ft @ 11s W swell and fresh 31 mph WSW winds, making it blown out across the region. On the day after, expect 4 ft @ 9s WSW with moderate 17 mph SSE winds—workable at sheltered spots like Woolacombe and Croyde Beach. Best: today.
