North Devon is firing today with solid 7 ft @10s W swell and fresh 17 mph WSW winds. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are looking good, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @10s WSW with moderate 13 mph ESE winds, still offering some fun at the same spots. Day after, conditions improve with 4 ft @13s W and light 5 mph SE winds, making for a clean surf day. Best: day after.
