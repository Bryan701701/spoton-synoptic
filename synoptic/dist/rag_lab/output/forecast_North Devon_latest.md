North Devon is looking solid over the next few days! Today, expect 4 ft @ 8s W with light SSW winds, making for clean conditions at spots like Porlock Weir and Lynmouth. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 4 ft but shifts to a longer 12s period with ESE winds, keeping it fun at Woolacombe and Croyde Beach. On the day after, conditions get a bit breezy with 4 ft @ 9s W and fresh WSW winds, so look for sheltered corners like Putsborough. Best: today.
