North Devon is looking solid today with 5 ft @9s WSW swell and fresh 17 mph S winds. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are both working well, with the best windows around mid-day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @12s, but with lighter 10 mph NNW winds, it should be clean and fun at spots like Woolacombe and Putsborough. Day after, conditions remain similar with 3 ft @9s WSW, but winds pick up to 15 mph S. Best: tomorrow.
