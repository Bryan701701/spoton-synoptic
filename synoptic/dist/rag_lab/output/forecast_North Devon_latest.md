North Devon is looking solid today with 4 ft @ 8s W and light SSW winds at 11 mph. Great options at Porlock Weir and Lynmouth, both offering fun conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 4 ft but gets a bit punchier with a longer period of 12s and lighter ESE winds, making it another good day to hit the water. On the day after, expect similar swell but with fresh WSW winds at 17 mph, which may make it a bit choppy. Best: tomorrow.
