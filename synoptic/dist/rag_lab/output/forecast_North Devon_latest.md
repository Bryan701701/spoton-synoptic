North Devon is lighting up today with 4 ft @10s W swell and a moderate 13 mph NW wind. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are great picks, with optimal tides for fun rides. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @6s SW with fresh 26 mph SSE winds, making it a tough day for surf. The day after, we see a bit more swell at 6 ft @9s WSW, but with strong 22 mph SW winds, it’ll be blown out. Best: today.
