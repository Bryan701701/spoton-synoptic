North Devon is looking solid today with 4 ft @10s WSW swell and fresh 15 mph SSE winds. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are both clean and workable, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 5 ft @13s WSW with moderate 12 mph WNW winds, keeping it fun across the board. Day after, conditions improve further with 4 ft @12s WSW and light 8 mph SE winds, making for a great surf day. Best: day after.
