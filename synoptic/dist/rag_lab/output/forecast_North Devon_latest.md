Today in North Devon, surf is small and poor at 1 ft @12s W with light 2 mph SE winds. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 2 ft @5s WNW, but fresh 16 mph WNW winds will make it choppy; Woolacombe and Putsborough may see some action. The day after brings 3 ft @5s WNW, but strong 24 mph NW winds will likely make it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
