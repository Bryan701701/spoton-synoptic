North Devon is looking solid today with 5 ft @ 13s W swell and moderate 14 mph NW winds. Best spots include Porlock Weir and Lynmouth, both offering clean conditions. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 4 ft @ 13s W, but with light S winds, it should still be fun at places like Woolacombe and Croyde Beach. By the day after, expect similar 4 ft @ 9s WSW conditions, with a bit of a shift in the swell direction. Best: today.
