Today in North Devon, we have clean 3 ft @ 7s WNW swell with a moderate 12 mph NW wind. Woolacombe and Putsborough are looking great, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 5 ft @ 7s WSW with fresh 19 mph SSW winds, making it poor across the board. Day after, surf picks up to 4 ft @ 9s W with lighter 9 mph SSW winds, bringing back some fun options. Best: today.
