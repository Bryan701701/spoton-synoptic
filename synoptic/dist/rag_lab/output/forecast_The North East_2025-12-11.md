Today is looking pretty quiet with 1 ft @4s SW across the North East, and fresh 14 mph SW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow brings a little improvement with 2 ft @6s ESE at Saltburn Beach, where conditions will be more workable thanks to lighter 12 mph WSW winds. The day after, Saltburn Beach still holds some fun with 1 ft @8s NNE, but it’s best for beginners as the swell drops. Best: tomorrow.
