Today in Donegal, Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are serving up fun 3 ft @ 11s WNW with a light E wind at 13 mph, making for some clean conditions. Tomorrow, expect similar 3 ft @ 12s WNW with a gentle NE breeze at 6 mph, perfect for a surf session at any of the local spots. Day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 11s WNW, still workable at sheltered beaches like Magheroaty and Dooey. Best: tomorrow.
