Today in Cornwall, the North coast is lighting up with 7 ft @ 14s W swell and light SSE winds. Crantock and Fistral are the top picks, especially during the early tides. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 6 ft @ 10s W swell and fresh SSW winds, making it a poor day across all coasts. By the day after, the swell remains at 6 ft but with similar windy conditions, keeping it less than ideal. Best: today.
