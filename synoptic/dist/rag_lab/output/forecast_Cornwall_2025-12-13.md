Today, Cornwall is lighting up with solid surf! North spots like Crantock and Fistral are offering 7ft @ 14s W with light SSE winds, making for clean conditions, especially early on the push. Down South, Porthcurno and Praa Sands are also in the mix with 7ft @ 13s W, light SE winds, and great tide windows. Over on the West, Sennen Cove and Gwenvor are peaking at 7ft @ 13s W with moderate SW winds, still workable. Tomorrow, expect a drop in quality across the board with fresh onshore winds. Day after, conditions remain poor. Best: today.
