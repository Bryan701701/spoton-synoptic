Today in Caithness, it's looking great with 6 ft @14s W swell and light 5 mph S winds. All the good spots are firing, including Point of Ness and Murkle Point, both best from 08:59 to 15:19. Tomorrow, conditions ease a bit with 6 ft @12s WNW swell and moderate 12 mph SSW winds, still workable at the same spots. Day after brings a solid 8 ft @10s W swell with light 8 mph WSW winds, making it a fun day at the beach. Best: today.
