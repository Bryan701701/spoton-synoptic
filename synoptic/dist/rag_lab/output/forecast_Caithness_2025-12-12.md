Today in Caithness, it's looking great with 6 ft @ 14s W swell and light 5 mph S winds. Spots like Point of Ness and Murkle Point are firing, especially during the mid-tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions remain decent with the same swell height but a slight drop in period to 12s, and winds picking up to 12 mph SSW, making it a bit choppy. By the day after, the swell increases to 8 ft @ 10s W with lighter winds, setting up for a solid surf day. Best: today.
