Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking good with 3 ft @6s NW swell and light 8 mph SSW winds. White Park Bay and Portballintrae are your best bets, especially during the tides from 08:50 to 16:13. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 6 ft @7s NNW swell but fresh 27 mph NNW winds will make it blown out—best to give it a miss. On the day after, we see a return to 3 ft @8s WNW swell with light 7 mph WSW winds, making for fun surf again at White Park Bay and Portballintrae. Best: today.
