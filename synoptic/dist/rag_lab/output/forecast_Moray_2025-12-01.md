Today in Moray, it's a quiet one with 3 ft @ 7s E swell, but fresh 20 mph S winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 1 ft @ 10s NNE swell and light 7 mph SSW winds at spots like Spey Bay and Lossiemouth, offering some fun for beginners. The day after, similar 1 ft @ 7s ENE swell continues, but with fresh 18 mph SSE winds, making it less inviting. Best: tomorrow.
