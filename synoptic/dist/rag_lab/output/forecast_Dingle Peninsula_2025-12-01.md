Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it's a solid 6 ft @ 8s WSW with light 10 mph SSW winds, making for clean conditions at spots like Ballybunion Right and Ballybunion Beach. Tomorrow, conditions take a turn for the worse with a hefty 13 ft @ 13s W swell and fresh 26 mph WSW winds, leading to blown-out surf. The day after continues the trend with similar size and wind, keeping it poor across the board. Best: today.
