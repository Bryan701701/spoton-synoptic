Today at Saltburn Beach, it's a clean 1 ft @ 6s SE with a moderate 12 mph WNW wind, making for fun conditions. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 1 ft @ 3s SSE with fresh 23 mph S winds, so it’s looking poor across the board. The day after stays similar with 1 ft @ 5s SSE and 19 mph SSW winds, keeping it blown out. Best: today.
