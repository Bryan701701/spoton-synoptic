Today in South Devon, conditions are poor with a swell of 4 ft @ 6s SW and fresh 22 mph SW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight increase to 5 ft @ 7s SSW, but the fresh 27 mph S winds will keep it messy. On the day after, we get a clean-up with 3 ft @ 7s SSW and lighter 11 mph N winds, making Challborough and Bantham the spots to check out. Best: day after.
