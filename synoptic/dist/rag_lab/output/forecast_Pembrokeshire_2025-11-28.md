Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a bit of a washout with fresh 25 mph SW winds making it blown out, despite the swell hitting 7 ft @9s WSW. Tomorrow, conditions improve significantly with a clean 6 ft @10s WSW swell and light 9 mph WNW winds, making for some fun waves at spots like Whitesands Bay. The day after, the swell drops to 4 ft @9s with similar light NNW winds, still offering good conditions. Best: tomorrow.
