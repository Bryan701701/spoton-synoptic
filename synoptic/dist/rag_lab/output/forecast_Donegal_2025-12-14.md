Today in Donegal, we have solid surf at 7 ft @ 11s W with fresh 15 mph S winds. Magheroaty Beach and Bloody Foreland are good picks, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 5 ft @ 12s W and light 7 mph SSE winds, making it a great day for Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand. The day after, expect similar fun at 6 ft @ 12s with light S winds. Best: tomorrow.
