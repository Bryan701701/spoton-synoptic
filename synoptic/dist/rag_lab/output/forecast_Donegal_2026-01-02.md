Today in Donegal, we have clean 2 ft @6s WNW lines with a light 13 mph N wind. Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand are your best bets, especially on the push. Tomorrow, the swell builds slightly to 3 ft @6s NW with a moderate 17 mph N wind, still offering fun options at the same spots. Day after, conditions improve further with 4 ft @8s NNW at Pollan Bay and others, but winds ease to a gentle 12 mph NNW. Best: day after.
