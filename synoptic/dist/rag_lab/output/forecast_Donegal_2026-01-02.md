Today in Donegal, surf is looking fun with 2 ft @ 6s WNW at spots like Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand, both working well under a light N wind at 13 mph. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 3 ft @ 6s NW, still holding shape at the same spots. By the day after, we see a solid 4 ft @ 8s NNW at places like Pollan Bay and Ballyheiran Bay, with lighter winds making for a great session. Best: day after.
