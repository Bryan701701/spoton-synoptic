Today in Pembrokeshire, conditions are poor with 3 ft @6s WNW swell and fresh 23 mph NW wind, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, things improve significantly with 4 ft @7s WSW swell and light 8 mph W wind, offering clean surf at spots like Whitesands Bay and Freshwater West. The day after, swell increases to 6 ft @8s W but fresh 22 mph NW wind will create challenging conditions again. Best: tomorrow.
