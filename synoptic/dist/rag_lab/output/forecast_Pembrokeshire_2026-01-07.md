Today in Pembrokeshire, conditions are poor with 3 ft @6s WNW swell and fresh 23 mph NW wind. It’s blown out, so best to skip the surf. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 4 ft @7s WSW with light 8 mph W winds, making for clean and fun conditions at spots like Whitesands Bay. Day after, the swell increases to 6 ft @8s W but is again met with fresh 22 mph NW winds, likely making it messy. Best: tomorrow.
