Today in County Sligo, Strandhill is the standout with 3 ft @ 11s NW and a moderate 13 mph E wind. It’s looking clean and fun, especially during the tide window from 08:55 to 16:14. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2 ft @ 9s, and it’s not producing much with light ENE winds. The day after continues the trend with 2 ft @ 6s, still not offering much for surfers. Best: today.
