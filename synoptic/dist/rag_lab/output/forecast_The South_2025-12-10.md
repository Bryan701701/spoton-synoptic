Today, the South is seeing poor conditions with 6 ft @10s SSW swell, but fresh 27 mph WSW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 8 ft @8s SSW, yet the winds ramp up to 37 mph SSW, keeping it messy. On the day after, conditions remain similar with 6 ft @10s SSW swell and 22 mph SSW winds, still not producing anything worthwhile. Best: none.
