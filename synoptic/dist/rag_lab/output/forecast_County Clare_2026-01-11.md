Today in County Clare, it's a bit of a struggle with 4 ft @ 8s WSW swell and fresh 22 mph S wind making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 3 ft @ 8s WSW with 21 mph SSW wind, still not producing much. By the day after, conditions improve with 3 ft @ 10s WNW swell and light 3 mph SSE wind, offering some clean options at spots like Lahinch Beach and Cregg Beach. Best: day after.
