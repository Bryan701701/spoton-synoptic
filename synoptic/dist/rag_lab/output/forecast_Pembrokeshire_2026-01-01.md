Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a bit of a bummer with 2 ft @5s WNW swell and fresh 16 mph WNW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight increase to 3 ft @5s WNW, but the wind picks up to 19 mph NW, keeping conditions poor. The day after remains similar with 3 ft @5s NW and 18 mph NNW winds. Best: none.
