Today, the South is quiet with 4 ft @9s SSW swell but fresh 18 mph SW wind making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with the same swell size but a stronger 27 mph SSW wind, keeping it messy. On the day after, the swell increases to 5 ft @7s SSW, but the wind picks up to a hefty 38 mph SSW, making it poor across the board. Best: today.
