Today, the South is quiet with 4 ft @9s SSW swell, but fresh 18 mph SW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with similar 4 ft @8s SSW swell and stronger 27 mph SSW winds, keeping it messy. Day after, the swell picks up slightly to 5 ft @7s SSW, but strong 38 mph SSW winds will continue to chop it up. Best: today.
