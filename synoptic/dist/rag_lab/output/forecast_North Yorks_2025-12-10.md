Today in North Yorks, it's a bit of a struggle with 2 ft @4s SSW swell and fresh 28 mph SW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow drops to 1 ft @3s SW with light 9 mph S winds, so it's looking pretty flat. The day after, conditions improve slightly to 2 ft @7s ESE with moderate 15 mph S winds, offering some workable windows during the tides. Best: day after.
