Today sees poor conditions across Caithness with 2 ft @6s NW swell and fresh 22 mph WNW winds. Tomorrow picks up to 6 ft @7s NW, but the fresh 35 mph NNW wind will make it blown out. Day after, swell drops slightly to 5 ft @7s NNE with even stronger 39 mph NNE winds, keeping things messy. Best: today.
