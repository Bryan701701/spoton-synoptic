Today on the Dingle Peninsula, we've got some fun surf at 2 ft @ 8s from the NW with fresh 17 mph ENE winds. Ballybunion Right and Ballybunion Beach are your best bets, especially during the morning and early afternoon tides. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with swell building to 3 ft @ 10s, still with fresh ENE winds. Day after, expect a drop to 2 ft @ 9s, but the fresh E wind will make it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
