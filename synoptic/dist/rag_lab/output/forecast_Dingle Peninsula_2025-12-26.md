Today on the Dingle Peninsula, we've got clean 2 ft @8s NW lines with fresh 17 mph ENE winds. Ballybunion Right and Ballybunion Beach are your best bets, especially during the early and mid-day tides. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 3 ft @10s W, still with fresh ENE winds, making for some fun conditions. By the day after, expect 2 ft @9s NW, but with stronger 25 mph E winds, it’ll be blown out. Best: tomorrow.
