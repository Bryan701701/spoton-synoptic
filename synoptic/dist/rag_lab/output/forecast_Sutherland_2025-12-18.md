Today in Sutherland, it's a no-go with poor conditions: 7 ft @12s W swell and fresh 32 mph SW wind making it blown out. Tomorrow, similar story with 7 ft @11s WSW swell and even stronger 39 mph SW winds, keeping it messy. Day after, the swell drops slightly to 6 ft @11s W, but with 22 mph S winds, it remains poor. Best: none.
