Today, the surf is quiet across Cornwall with a weak 2 ft @8s swell from the N, but fresh 18 mph ENE winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 2 ft @9s from the NNW and moderate 11 mph ENE winds, still not producing much. By the day after, we see a slight improvement with 2 ft @11s WNW and lighter 7 mph E winds, offering some fun options at spots like Town and Watergate Bay. Best: day after.
