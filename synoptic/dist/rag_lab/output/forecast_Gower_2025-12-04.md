Today, Gower is looking solid with 5 ft @ 8s WSW swell and fresh 13 mph NNW winds. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are your best bets, both offering fun conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 5 ft @ 10s WSW swell and light 7 mph SW winds, making it a great day for a surf session. On the day after, expect a hefty 11 ft @ 11s WSW swell but with strong 27 mph SW winds, likely making it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
