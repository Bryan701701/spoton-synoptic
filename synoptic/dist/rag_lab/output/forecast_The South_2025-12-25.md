Today in The South, it's looking poor with 4 ft @6s E swell and fresh 25 mph ENE winds, making for a blown-out situation. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 3 ft @6s ESE with 24 mph ENE winds, still not ideal. The day after continues the trend with 3 ft @5s E swell and fresh 30 mph ENE winds, keeping conditions challenging. Best: tomorrow.
