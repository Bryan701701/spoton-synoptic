Today in North Yorks, it’s looking fun with 4 ft @ 8s NE swell and light 5 mph WSW winds. Withernsea and Filey are prime spots, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with the same swell but fresh 21 mph NE winds making it blown out and poor across the board. The day after, we bounce back with similar 4 ft @ 8s ENE swell and calm 0 mph S winds, making for clean surf at spots like Withernsea and Filey. Best: today.
