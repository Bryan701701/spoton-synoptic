Today in the Hebrides, the surf is 6 ft @10s WSW with fresh 21 mph SW winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with 8 ft @13s W and 23 mph S winds, still not producing anything clean. The day after, we see similar 6 ft @11s WSW but with stronger 30 mph SSE winds, keeping it messy. Best: none.
