Today in Donegal, conditions are poor with a hefty swell of 7 ft @10s from the WSW, but fresh 28 mph onshore winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell ramps up to 16 ft @17s, still with fresh 23 mph SSW winds, keeping it messy and challenging. The day after, expect an even bigger swell at 18 ft @14s, with strong 29 mph WSW winds, making it a tough day for surfing. Best: none.
