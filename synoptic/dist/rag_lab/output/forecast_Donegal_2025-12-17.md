Today in Donegal, conditions are poor with a hefty 7 ft @10s WSW swell, but fresh 28 mph S winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell ramps up to 16 ft @17s, still with fresh 23 mph SSW winds, keeping it messy. The day after, expect even bigger surf at 18 ft @14s, with strong 29 mph WSW winds adding to the chaos. Best: none.
