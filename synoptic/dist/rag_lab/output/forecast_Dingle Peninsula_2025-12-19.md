Today on the Dingle Peninsula, conditions are poor with a hefty 15 ft @ 13s W swell and fresh 31 mph W wind making it blown out. Tomorrow remains challenging with a 10 ft @ 10s SW swell and stronger 43 mph SSE winds, keeping it messy. However, day after looks promising with 11 ft @ 14s W swell and lighter 12 mph SE winds, offering some clean options at spots like Ballybunion Left and Garywilliam Point. Best: day after.
