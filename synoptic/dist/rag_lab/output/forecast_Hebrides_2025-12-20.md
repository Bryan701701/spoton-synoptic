Today in the Hebrides, it's a bit rough with 7 ft @10s WSW swell and fresh 29 mph SSE winds. Tomorrow sees a slight increase to 8 ft @14s WSW, but the wind remains fresh at 23 mph ESE, keeping it messy. By the day after, conditions improve with 5 ft @12s W swell and lighter 13 mph ESE winds, making it more workable at spots like Europie and Barvas. Best: day after.
