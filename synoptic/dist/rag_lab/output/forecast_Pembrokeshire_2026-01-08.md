Today in Pembrokeshire, surf is rolling in at 3 ft @ 6s W with a moderate 13 mph WNW wind. It's a good day for sheltered spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @ 8s W but with fresh 23 mph NW winds, making it blown out across the board. By the day after, we see a nice improvement with 5 ft @ 10s WSW and light 8 mph NW winds, perfect for a fun session at spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay. Best: day after.
