Today in Pembrokeshire, surf is looking fun with 3 ft @ 6s W and fresh 13 mph WNW winds. Spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are clean and workable, especially during the mid-tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @ 8s W but with fresh 23 mph NW winds, making it blown out across the board. Day after, expect a solid 5 ft @ 10s WSW with light 8 mph NW winds, offering great opportunities at all the top spots. Best: day after.
