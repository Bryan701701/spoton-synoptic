Today in Pembrokeshire, it's looking good with 2 ft @9s WSW swell and light E winds. Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are both clean and fun, especially on the mid-tide push. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 2 ft @7s S swell and fresh E winds, making it poor across the board. By the day after, it stays small at 1 ft @7s SSW, with only St Brides Bay and Tenby showing some potential. Best: today.
