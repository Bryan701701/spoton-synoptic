Today in Pembrokeshire, surf is looking fun at 2 ft @ 9s WSW with light E winds. Good spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are clean and working well, especially on the mid-tide push. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2 ft @ 7s S with fresh E winds, making it poor across the board. By the day after, it stays small at 1 ft @ 7s SSW, with only St Brides Bay and Tenby showing some potential. Best: today.
