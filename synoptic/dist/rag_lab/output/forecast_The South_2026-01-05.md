Today, the South is quiet with a weak 1 ft @6s W swell and fresh 17 mph NNW wind, making for blown-out conditions. Tomorrow, it drops to flat with no surf energy, so best to give it a miss. On the day after, the swell returns to 1 ft @6s SW, but the fresh 18 mph WNW wind will keep it messy. Best: today.
