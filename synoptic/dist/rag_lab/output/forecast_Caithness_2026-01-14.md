Today in Caithness, it's looking solid with 6 ft @8s WNW swell and a light 12 mph SW wind. Points like Point of Ness and Murkle Point are clean and working well. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @11s SE with a fresh 15 mph S wind, making it less appealing. By the day after, conditions improve again with 5 ft @14s W swell and lighter 8 mph SSW winds, bringing back some fun. Best: today.
