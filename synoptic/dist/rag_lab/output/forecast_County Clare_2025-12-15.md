Today in County Clare, it's a solid 7 ft @ 12s W with light 6 mph S winds. Great conditions at Crab Island and Doolin Point, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, expect a drop to 4 ft @ 12s WNW with moderate 12 mph SSW winds, still workable at spots like Lahinch Beach and Doolin Point. Day after, the swell picks up again to 9 ft @ 10s WSW, but with fresh 18 mph SSW winds, so look for sheltered corners. Best: today.
