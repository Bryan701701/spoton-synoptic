County Clare is looking solid! Today, enjoy 7 ft @ 12s W with light 6 mph S winds at spots like Crab Island and Doolin Point. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @ 12s WNW with moderate 12 mph SSW winds, still providing some fun at places like Lahinch Beach. By the day after, the swell picks up to 9 ft @ 10s WSW but with fresh 18 mph SSW winds, so expect some chop. Best: today.
