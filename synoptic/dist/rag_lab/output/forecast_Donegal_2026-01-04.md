Today in Donegal, it's looking solid with 5 ft @9s NNW swell and fresh 14 mph NNW winds. Great conditions at spots like Pollan Bay and Ballyheiran Bay, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 5 ft @8s NNW, but winds pick up to 18 mph NE, making it a bit choppy. On the day after, expect 4 ft @7s NW with 15 mph SSW winds, offering some workable options at Magheroaty Beach and others. Best: today.
