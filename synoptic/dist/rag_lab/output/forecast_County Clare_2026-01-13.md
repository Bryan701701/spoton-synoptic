County Clare is looking solid today with 3 ft @ 8s WNW swell and light NNW winds at 7 mph. Lahinch Beach and Cregg Beach are both firing, offering fun waves throughout the day. Tomorrow sees a shift with 4 ft @ 9s W swell but fresh S winds at 20 mph, making it blown out and poor across the board. By the day after, conditions improve slightly with 9 ft @ 13s W swell, but WSW winds at 17 mph will still create some challenges. Best: today.
