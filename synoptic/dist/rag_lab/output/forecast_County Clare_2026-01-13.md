County Clare is looking solid today with 3 ft @ 8s WNW swell and light 7 mph NNW winds. Lahinch Beach and Cregg Beach are both clean and fun, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @ 9s W with fresh 20 mph S winds, making it blown out across the board. By the day after, we see a significant jump to 9 ft @ 13s W, but the wind will still be 17 mph WSW, so expect mixed conditions. Best: today.
