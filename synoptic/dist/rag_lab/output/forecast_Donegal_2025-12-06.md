Today in Donegal, it's looking solid with 6 ft @ 13s W swell and fresh 13 mph SSW winds. Magheroaty Beach and Bloody Foreland are your best bets, both offering fun conditions from 08:42 to 16:05. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 6 ft @ 11s W swell but winds pick up to 17 mph SSE, so expect a bit more chop. By the day after, the swell holds at 6 ft @ 10s WSW with 16 mph SW winds, still providing good options at the same spots. Best: today.
