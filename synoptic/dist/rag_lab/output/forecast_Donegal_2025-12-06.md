Today in Donegal, it's looking solid with 6 ft @ 13s W swell and fresh 13 mph SSW winds. Magheroaty Beach and Bloody Foreland are both clean and working well, especially on the mid-tide push. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 6 ft but drops to 11s, with winds picking up to 17 mph SSE, still offering some fun options at the same spots. Day after, the swell remains at 6 ft but shifts to 10s WSW with 16 mph SW winds, keeping it lively. Best: today.
