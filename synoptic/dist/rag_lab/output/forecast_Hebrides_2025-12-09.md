Today in the Hebrides, it's looking poor with 6 ft @12s WSW swell but fresh 21 mph ESE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell ramps up to 15 ft @11s WSW, but with strong 47 mph SW winds, conditions will remain challenging. The day after brings a 10 ft @10s WSW swell with 35 mph S winds, still not ideal. Best: none.
