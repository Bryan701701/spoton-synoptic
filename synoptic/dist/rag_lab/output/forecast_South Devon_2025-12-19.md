Today in South Devon, conditions are poor with a fresh 23 mph WSW wind on 5 ft @ 8s SW swell, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 4 ft @ 7s SW and lighter 13 mph S winds, offering some workable options at spots like Bovisand Reef and Bantham during the mid-day push. Day after brings cleaner conditions with 4 ft @ 9s SW and light 8 mph NE winds, making it a great day to hit the water. Best: day after.
