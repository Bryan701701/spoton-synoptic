Today in South Devon, conditions are poor with 5 ft @8s SW swell but fresh 23 mph WSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 4 ft @7s SW swell and lighter 13 mph S winds, offering some workable options at spots like Bovisand Reef and Bantham during the mid-day push. The day after looks promising with 4 ft @9s SW swell and light 8 mph NE winds, providing clean conditions at the same spots. Best: day after.
