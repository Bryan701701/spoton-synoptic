Today in South Devon, conditions are poor with 5 ft @8s SW swell and fresh 23 mph WSW winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 4 ft @7s SW swell and lighter 13 mph S winds, offering some workable waves at spots like Bovisand Reef. Day after looks promising with 4 ft @9s SW swell and light 8 mph NE winds, creating clean conditions at the usual spots. Best: day after.
