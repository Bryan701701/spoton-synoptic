Today on the Causeway Coast, Portballintrae is offering some fun with 1 ft @ 10s WNW and a moderate 14 mph SSE wind. It’s a great time to catch some small waves, especially during the tide window from 08:37 to 15:57. Tomorrow, conditions drop slightly to 2 ft @ 7s WSW, but with a fresh 25 mph SSW wind, it’ll be blown out. The day after continues with 2 ft @ 6s ESE and similar winds, keeping it poor across the coast. Best: today.
