Today, Portballintrae is your go-to with 1 ft @10s WNW and a moderate 14 mph SSE wind; it’s clean early, best on the push from 08:37 to 15:57. Tomorrow, the swell picks up slightly to 2 ft @7s WSW, but fresh 25 mph SSW winds will make it messy across the coast. The day after, similar conditions persist with 2 ft @6s ESE and 24 mph SSE winds, keeping it poor. Best: today.
