Today in Sutherland, it’s looking solid with 5 ft @11s NW swell and fresh 26 mph S winds. Melvich and Strathy are both firing, with good tides in the afternoon. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @12s NW, but conditions remain fun with lighter 13 mph S winds. Day after, expect 3 ft @10s NW swell with a moderate SE breeze—still workable at spots like Melvich and Strathy. Best: today.
