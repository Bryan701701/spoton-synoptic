Today on the East Coast, it's looking good with 3 ft @6s S swell and a light 11 mph SSW wind. Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay are your top picks, especially during the morning and early afternoon tides. Tomorrow, expect a drop to 4 ft @6s S, but fresh 33 mph SSW winds will make it blown out and not workable. Day after, conditions improve slightly with 2 ft @5s S, light 9 mph S winds, making it more manageable at the same good spots. Best: today.
