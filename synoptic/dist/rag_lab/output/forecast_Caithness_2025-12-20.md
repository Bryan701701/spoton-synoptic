Today in Caithness, it's looking good with 5 ft @ 11s W swell and a light 13 mph S wind. Sheltered spots like Point of Ness and Murkle Point are working well, especially during the mid-tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @ 13s W with fresh 25 mph ESE winds, making it less favorable. The day after holds similar 4 ft @ 11s W swell but still faces those brisk ESE winds. Best: today.
