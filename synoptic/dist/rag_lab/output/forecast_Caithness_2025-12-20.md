Today in Caithness, it’s looking solid with 5 ft @11s W swell and light S winds at 13 mph. Sheltered spots like Point of Ness and Murkle Point are working well, especially during the mid-tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @13s W with fresh ESE winds at 25 mph, making it less favorable. The day after remains similar with 4 ft @11s W, but the wind stays strong, so it’s best to seek shelter. Best: today.
