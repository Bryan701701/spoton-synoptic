Today in South Devon, it's looking solid with 5 ft @8s SW swell and fresh 13 mph SSE winds. Bovisand Reef and Challborough are both working well, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @10s SW with light 8 mph NE winds, making for a fun day at Challborough and Bantham. The day after, expect 3 ft @6s SW with gentle 4 mph SE winds, still good at Challborough and Bantham. Best: today.
