Today, the South is showing some fun at Strand with a swell of 2 ft @ 7s S and fresh 17 mph WNW winds. It's a bit choppy, but sheltered corners should be workable. Tomorrow drops to 1 ft @ 5s SSW, so not much happening. Day after, still small at 1 ft @ 7s SW, but with lighter winds, it might be a bit cleaner. Best: today.
