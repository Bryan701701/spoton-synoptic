Today in Cornwall, North is lighting up with solid 7 ft @ 13s W swell and light SSE winds. Crantock and Fistral are prime picks, especially early on the push. Tomorrow, conditions shift as the swell ramps up to 13 ft but with fresh WSW winds making it blown out. By the day after, the swell drops back to 7 ft @ 12s, with more manageable winds, making it workable again at the sheltered spots. Best: today.
