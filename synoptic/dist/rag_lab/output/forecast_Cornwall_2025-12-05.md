Today in Cornwall, North is lighting up with solid 7 ft @ 13s W swell and light 10 mph SSE winds. Crantock and Fistral are prime picks, especially during the early tides. Tomorrow, conditions take a turn with strong winds and a hefty swell, making it poor across the board. By the day after, North settles back to 7 ft @ 12s W with manageable winds, offering a workable surf day. Best: today.
