Today, Cornwall is lighting up with clean 7 ft @ 13s W swell and light 10 mph SSE winds. Crantock and Fistral are prime spots, especially on the early tides, offering fun conditions. Tomorrow, expect a significant increase in swell to 13 ft @ 12s W, but fresh 38 mph WSW winds will make it blown out across the region. Day after, conditions improve slightly with 7 ft @ 12s W and 16 mph SW winds, making it workable at the North coast. Best: today.
