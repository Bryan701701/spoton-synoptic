Today in Cornwall, North coast is lighting up with clean 7 ft @ 13s W swell and light 10 mph SSE winds. Crantock and Fistral are prime spots, especially early on the push. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 13 ft @ 12s W swell and fresh 38 mph WSW winds, making it poor across the board. On the day after, North coast sees 7 ft @ 12s W with 16 mph SW winds, offering workable conditions again. Best: today.
