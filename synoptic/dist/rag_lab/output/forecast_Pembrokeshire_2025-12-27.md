Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a quiet day with 2 ft @ 6s SE swell and fresh 7 mph NE wind across all spots. Tomorrow stays similar with 2 ft @ 7s SE, still not producing much. The day after, conditions improve slightly with 2 ft @ 10s WSW, and some spots like St Brides Bay and Tenby may offer fun, clean waves. Best: day after.
