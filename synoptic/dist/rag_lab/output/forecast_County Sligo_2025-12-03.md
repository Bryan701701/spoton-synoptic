Today in County Sligo, it's looking great with 6 ft @ 12s WNW swell and light 12 mph S winds. Strandhill and Easkey spots are firing, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 5 ft @ 10s, still clean with light winds, making it a fun day for a surf. On the day after, conditions worsen with 7 ft @ 13s WNW swell but fresh 28 mph SSE winds will make it blown out. Best: today.
