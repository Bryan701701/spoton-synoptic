County Sligo is lighting up today with 6 ft @12s WNW swell and a light 12 mph S wind. Strandhill and Easkey spots are the picks, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 5 ft @10s, but with lighter 6 mph S winds, it should still be clean and fun. Day after, expect 7 ft @13s, but fresh 28 mph SSE winds will make it blown out. Best: today.
