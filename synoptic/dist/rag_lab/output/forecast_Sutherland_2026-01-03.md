Today in Sutherland, it's a bit of a tough one with poor conditions—11 ft @10s N swell and fresh 29 mph N wind making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 8 ft @9s with similar fresh NNW winds, still not ideal. Day after looks a bit better with 7 ft @9s N swell and lighter 13 mph NNE winds, providing some workable options at spots like Sango Bay. Best: day after.
