Today in Sutherland, it's a bit rough with 11 ft @10s N swell and fresh 29 mph N winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, conditions remain poor with 8 ft @9s N swell and 28 mph NNW winds, still not ideal. However, on the day after, things improve slightly to 7 ft @9s N with lighter 13 mph NNE winds, offering some workable options at spots like Sango Bay and Strathy during the tide windows. Best: day after.
