Northwest Wales is looking good today with 4 ft @ 7s WSW swell and a fresh 15 mph SW wind. Porth Oer and Hells Mouth (beach) are your best bets, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 5 ft @ 8s with a strong 25 mph S wind, making it blown out and not producing well. Day after, swell picks up to 6 ft @ 8s, but still with fresh SSW winds; sheltered spots like Porth Oer should be fun. Best: today.
