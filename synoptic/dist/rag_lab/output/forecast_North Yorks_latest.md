Today in North Yorks, it's a quiet scene with 1 ft @4s SW and fresh 22 mph WSW winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 2 ft @7s ESE, but still fresh 17 mph S winds will keep things choppy. The day after, conditions remain similar with 2 ft @7s NNW, and winds easing to 13 mph SSW, but still not ideal. Best: tomorrow.
