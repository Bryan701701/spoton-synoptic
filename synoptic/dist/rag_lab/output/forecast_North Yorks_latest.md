Today in North Yorks, surf is on at 2 ft @ 8s NE with fresh 16 mph SW winds. Withernsea, Filey, and Whitby Beach are all working well, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, expect similar conditions with 2 ft @ 7s E and lighter 13 mph S winds, keeping it fun at the same spots. Day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 5s SE, but the surf remains consistent. Best: today.
