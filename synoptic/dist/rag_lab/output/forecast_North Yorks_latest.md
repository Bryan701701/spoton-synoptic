Today in North Yorks, we're seeing some fun options with 2 ft @ 8s NE swell and fresh 16 mph SW winds. Withernsea, Filey, and Whitby Beach are all working well, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions will be similar with 2 ft @ 7s E swell and moderate 13 mph S winds, still offering some playful surf. The day after, expect a drop to 2 ft @ 5s SE with fresh 18 mph S winds, making it a bit choppy. Best: today.
