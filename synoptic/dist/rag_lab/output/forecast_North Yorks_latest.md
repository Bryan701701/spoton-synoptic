North Yorks is looking fun today with 2 ft @7s ENE swell and fresh 16 mph SW winds. Withernsea and Filey are your best bets, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop slightly to 2 ft @6s SE with 14 mph S winds, still offering some workable options. By the day after, things quiet down to 1 ft @4s SSE, so best to enjoy the surf while you can! Best: today.
