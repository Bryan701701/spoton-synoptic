Today in North Yorks, it's looking poor with 3 ft @6s ESE swell and fresh 27 mph SSE winds—definitely blown out. Tomorrow stays similar, with 3 ft @6s SSE swell and 21 mph SSW winds, still not producing much. The day after drops to 1 ft @4s S with light 7 mph SW winds, making it quite flat. Best: tomorrow.
