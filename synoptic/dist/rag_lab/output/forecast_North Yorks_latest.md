North Yorks is seeing some fun surf today with 1 ft @ 8s N swell and fresh 15 mph WSW winds. Withernsea and Filey are your best bets, especially during the mid-morning and afternoon tides. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2 ft @ 4s SSW with similar winds, making it a poor day for surf. The day after looks to be more of the same, with 2 ft @ 4s S and fresh winds. Best: today.
