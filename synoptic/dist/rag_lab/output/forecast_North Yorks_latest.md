Today in North Yorks, we have clean 3 ft @9s NNE swell with a fresh 15 mph N wind. Withernsea and Filey are great picks, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @8s NNE with a stronger 20 mph NNE wind, making it poor across the board. Day after, we see a solid improvement with 5 ft @9s N swell and light 7 mph W winds, perfect for a fun surf day. Best: day after.
