Today in North Yorks, it's looking solid with 5 ft @8s ENE swell and fresh 14 mph ENE winds. Withernsea and Filey are prime spots, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @6s with fresh 28 mph SSE winds, making it a poor day for surf. The day after continues the trend with 2 ft @6s SSE and 18 mph SSW winds, keeping it flat. Best: today.
