Today in North Yorks, it's a bit of a struggle with 2 ft @7s E swell and fresh 22 mph S winds, making for blown-out conditions. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 1 ft @8s N, but the wind eases to 16 mph SW, offering a better chance for some fun at spots like Withernsea and Whitby Beach during the tide windows. The day after, conditions remain poor with 2 ft @4s SSW swell and fresh 21 mph SW winds. Best: tomorrow.
