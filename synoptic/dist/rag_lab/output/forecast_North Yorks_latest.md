Today in North Yorks, it's looking good with 4 ft @ 7s E swell and fresh 16 mph E winds. Withernsea and Filey are prime spots, especially around their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @ 5s E with fresh 22 mph ENE winds, making it a poor day for surf. On the day after, expect similar 3 ft @ 5s E swell but with lighter 13 mph ENE winds—still not great. Best: today.
