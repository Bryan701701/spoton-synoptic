Today in North Yorks, it's looking fun with 3 ft @5s E swell and fresh 17 mph ENE winds. Good spots like Withernsea and Filey are working well, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @4s ENE with similar winds, keeping it mellow but still rideable at places like Whitby Beach. By the day after, conditions improve with 3 ft @7s NE swell and light 8 mph NE winds, making it a great day for a surf session at Withernsea or Filey. Best: day after.
