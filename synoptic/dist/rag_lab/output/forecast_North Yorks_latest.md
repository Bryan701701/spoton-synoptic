North Yorks is looking good today with 3 ft @8s N swell and a moderate 14 mph W wind. Withernsea and Filey are solid picks, both offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop with fresh 40 mph WNW winds, making it blown out and not producing. Day after, expect a nice comeback with 4 ft @8s NE swell and light 9 mph SSE winds, perfect for a surf session. Best: day after.
