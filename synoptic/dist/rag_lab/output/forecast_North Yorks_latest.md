Today, North Yorks is lighting up with clean 4 ft @ 8s NE swell and light 5 mph WSW winds. Withernsea and Filey are prime spots, especially around their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions shift as fresh 21 mph NE winds blow in, making for poor surf across the region. Day after, the wind eases to calm 0 mph S, with the swell back to 4 ft @ 8s ENE, making it a great day to hit the beach again. Best: today.
