North Yorks is looking fun today with 2 ft @7s ENE swell and fresh 16 mph SW winds. Withernsea and Filey are your best bets, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 2 ft @6s SE, but still offers workable conditions at the same spots. Day after, things quiet down with 1 ft @4s SSE, so it’s a good time to rest. Best: today.
