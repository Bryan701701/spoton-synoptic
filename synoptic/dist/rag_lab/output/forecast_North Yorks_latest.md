Today in North Yorks, it's a bit of a struggle with fresh 22 mph WNW winds and 6 ft @9s N swell. All spots are blown out, so it's best to give it a miss. Tomorrow sees an increase to 8 ft @9s N, but with stronger 31 mph NW winds, conditions will remain poor. Day after, the swell drops to 4 ft @8s N with lighter 14 mph NW winds, still not ideal. Best: none.
