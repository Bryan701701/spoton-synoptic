Today, North Yorks is quiet with 1 ft @4s S swell and fresh 16 mph SW wind—definitely not producing. Tomorrow sees a slight bump to 2 ft @4s SSW, but with strong 28 mph SW winds, conditions will be blown out. Day after drops back to 1 ft @3s S with light 8 mph SSW winds, still not ideal. Best: tomorrow.
