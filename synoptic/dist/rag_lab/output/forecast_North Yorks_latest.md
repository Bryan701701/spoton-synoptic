Today in North Yorks, it's looking fun with 3 ft @5s ENE swell and fresh 18 mph ENE winds. Withernsea and Filey are your best bets, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @5s with lighter 13 mph ENE winds, still workable at the same spots. By the day after, conditions ease further to 2 ft @4s, but the wind stays light, making it a mellow day. Best: today.
