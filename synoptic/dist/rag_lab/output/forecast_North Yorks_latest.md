Today is looking poor across North Yorks with 6 ft @8s N swell, but fresh 36 mph NW winds are blowing it out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 3 ft @8s N and lighter 14 mph WSW winds, making it workable at spots like Withernsea and Filey during the tide windows. The day after, conditions drop again to 5 ft @6s NNW with fresh 37 mph NNW winds, leading to another blown out day. Best: tomorrow.
