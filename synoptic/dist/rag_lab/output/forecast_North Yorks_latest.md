Today is looking pretty quiet across North Yorks with 1 ft @3s SE swell and fresh 14 mph S winds. Tomorrow remains similar with 1 ft @5s SSE swell and 16 mph SW winds, so not much to get excited about. The day after, we see a slight increase to 2 ft @4s SSW, but with strong 27 mph SW winds, it’ll be blown out. Best: day after.
