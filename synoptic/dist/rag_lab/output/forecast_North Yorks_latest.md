Today in North Yorks, expect fun 2 ft @8s NE lines with a fresh 16 mph SW wind. Withernsea, Filey, and Whitby Beach are all working well, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 2 ft @7s E swell and a lighter 13 mph S wind, still offering some rideable waves. Day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @5s SE with a moderate 18 mph S wind, making it less appealing. Best: today.
