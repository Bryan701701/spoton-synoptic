Today in North Yorks, it's looking pretty flat with 2 ft @4s SSW swell and fresh 31 mph SW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, similar conditions persist with 2 ft @4s SSE swell and 26 mph SSW winds, so still not much happening. By the day after, the swell drops to 1 ft @5s ESE with lighter 16 mph NNW winds, keeping it quiet. Best: none.
