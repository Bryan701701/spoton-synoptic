North Yorks is looking fun today with 2 ft @7s ENE swell and fresh 16 mph SW winds. Withernsea and Filey are your best bets, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 2 ft @6s SE, but still offers workable conditions at multiple spots. By the day after, conditions fade to 1 ft @4s SSE, so it’s best to get out while you can! Best: today.
