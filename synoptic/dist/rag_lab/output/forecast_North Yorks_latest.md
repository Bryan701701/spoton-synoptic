Today in North Yorks, Withernsea, Filey, and Whitby Beach are all working with 2 ft @8s NE swell and fresh 16 mph SW winds. Best times are mid-morning to early afternoon. Tomorrow, expect similar conditions with a slight drop to 2 ft @7s E and 13 mph S winds, still offering some fun at the same spots. Day after, the swell continues to fade to 2 ft @5s SE with 18 mph S winds, but still some workable corners. Best: today.
