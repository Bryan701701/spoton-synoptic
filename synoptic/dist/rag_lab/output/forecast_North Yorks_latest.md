Today in North Yorks, it's a fun 2 ft @ 4s ENE with a fresh 15 mph NE wind. Withernsea and Filey are your best bets, both offering clean conditions during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell builds slightly to 3 ft @ 7s NE, still with a moderate NE wind, keeping it workable at the same spots. Day after, conditions improve further with 3 ft @ 8s NNE and lighter winds, making it a great day to hit the water. Best: day after.
