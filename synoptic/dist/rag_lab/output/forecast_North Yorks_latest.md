Today in North Yorks, we’ve got clean conditions with 2 ft @ 4s ENE swell and fresh 15 mph NE winds. Withernsea and Filey are your best bets, both offering fun peaks throughout the day. Tomorrow, expect a slight bump to 3 ft @ 7s NE, still with fresh NE winds, keeping it lively. Day after, conditions improve further with 3 ft @ 8s NNE swell and lighter winds, making it a great day to hit the water. Best: day after.
