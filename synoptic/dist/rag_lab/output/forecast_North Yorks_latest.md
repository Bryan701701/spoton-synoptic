Today across North Yorks, it's a quiet scene with 1 ft @ 4s SE swell and fresh 17 mph SW winds, making for blown-out conditions. Tomorrow, the same swell size and angle persist, keeping it poor with no improvement in sight. Day after, the swell drops slightly to 1 ft @ 3s SSE, with similar wind conditions, continuing the trend of lackluster surf. Best: none.
