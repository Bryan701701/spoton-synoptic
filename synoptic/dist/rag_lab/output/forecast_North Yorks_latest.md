Today in North Yorks, there are clean, small waves at 1 ft @ 8s from the N with a fresh 15 mph WSW wind. Withernsea and Filey are both working well, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2 ft @ 4s from the SSW with a moderate 17 mph wind, making it less favorable. The day after follows suit with similar poor conditions. Best: today.
