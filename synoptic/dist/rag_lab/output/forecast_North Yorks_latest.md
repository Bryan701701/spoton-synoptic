Today in North Yorks, conditions are poor with a fresh 21 mph NE wind creating a blown-out scene. The swell is 4 ft @ 6s from the ENE, but it’s not producing anything clean. Tomorrow sees an improvement with 6 ft @ 8s ENE swell and lighter 13 mph ENE winds, making it a better day for surf. The day after drops back to 3 ft @ 6s with a 16 mph S wind, still workable but not as exciting. Best: tomorrow.
