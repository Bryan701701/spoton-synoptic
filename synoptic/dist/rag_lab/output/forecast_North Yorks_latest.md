Today in North Yorks, conditions are poor with 6 ft @8s N swell and fresh 36 mph NW winds. It's blown out across the board, so best to give it a miss. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 3 ft @8s N and moderate 14 mph WSW winds, making it workable at spots like Filey and Whitby Beach during the mid-tide push. The day after, swell increases to 5 ft @6s NNW but remains poor with strong 37 mph NNW winds. Best: tomorrow.
