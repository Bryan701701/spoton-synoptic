Today in North Yorks, it’s looking great with 4 ft @9s NNE swell and light 8 mph W winds. Withernsea and Filey are prime spots, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with fresh 21 mph WNW winds making it blown out and poor across the board. Day after, expect 9 ft @10s N swell with strong 35 mph NW winds, so it’ll be rough and not workable. Best: today.
