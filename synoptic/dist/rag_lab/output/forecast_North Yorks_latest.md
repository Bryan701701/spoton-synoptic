Today in North Yorks, it’s a fun 2 ft @ 5s ESE with a light 10 mph ESE wind. Good spots like Withernsea and Filey are working well, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, expect a bump to 4 ft @ 6s with fresh 17 mph ESE winds; it’ll be a bit choppy but still rideable at places like Bunkers and Pumphouse. The day after, conditions drop back to 2 ft @ 6s with moderate 14 mph ESE winds; still some fun to be had at sheltered spots. Best: tomorrow.
