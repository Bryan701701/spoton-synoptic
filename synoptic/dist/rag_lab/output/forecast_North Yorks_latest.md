Today in North Yorks, it's a bit of a struggle with 2 ft @4s SSW swell and fresh 31 mph SW winds making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow drops to 1 ft @4s SSW, still with 16 mph SSW winds, so not much to work with. Day after brings a slight improvement with 2 ft @4s ESE swell and lighter 13 mph ESE winds, making for some workable conditions at spots like Withernsea and Filey. Best: day after.
