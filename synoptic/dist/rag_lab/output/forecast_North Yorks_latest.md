Today in North Yorks, expect clean 2 ft @8s NE swell with fresh 16 mph SW winds. Withernsea, Filey, and Whitby Beach are all working well, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 2 ft @7s E, with lighter 13 mph S winds, keeping conditions manageable. Day after, the swell continues to drop to 2 ft @5s SE with fresh 18 mph S winds, but still some options at the beaches. Best: today.
