Today in North Yorks, it's a fun 4 ft @ 7s E with a fresh 16 mph E wind. Withernsea and Filey are looking solid, especially on the mid-tide push. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @ 5s E with a stronger 22 mph ENE wind, making it poor across the board. Day after, still 3 ft @ 5s E but with lighter 13 mph ENE winds, so some sheltered spots like Withernsea and Filey may offer a workable session. Best: today.
