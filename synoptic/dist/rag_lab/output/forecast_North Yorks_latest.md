Today in North Yorks, it's a bit of a struggle with 2 ft @6s SE lines and fresh 19 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow drops to 1 ft @5s SSE, still messy with the same wind. Day after brings back 2 ft @4s WNW, but the wind is light at 10 mph SSW, offering a slight improvement. Best: day after.
