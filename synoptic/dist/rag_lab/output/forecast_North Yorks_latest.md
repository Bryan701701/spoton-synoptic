Today, North Yorks is not producing with 6 ft @8s N swell and fresh 36 mph NW winds creating a blown-out mess. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 3 ft @8s N swell and moderate 14 mph WSW winds, offering some workable conditions at spots like Withernsea and Filey. The day after, conditions drop again to 5 ft @6s NNW with fresh 37 mph NNW winds, keeping it poor across the board. Best: tomorrow.
