North Yorks is looking solid today with 4 ft @ 8s NNE swell and a moderate 12 mph NE wind. Withernsea and Filey are both prime spots, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 3 ft @ 8s, but still offers fun conditions at the same locations. By the day after, we're back up to 5 ft @ 8s, making it a great time to hit the water again. Best: today.
