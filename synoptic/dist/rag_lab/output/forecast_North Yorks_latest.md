North Yorks is looking fun today with 3 ft @6s E swell and fresh 16 mph ESE winds. Withernsea and Filey are your best bets, both offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, expect similar 3 ft @6s with lighter 13 mph E winds, keeping the surf consistent. Day after, the swell drops slightly to 3 ft @5s with ENE winds at 14 mph, still providing workable waves. Best: today.
