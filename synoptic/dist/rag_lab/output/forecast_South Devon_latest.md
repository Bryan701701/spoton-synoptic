Today, South Devon is seeing poor conditions with a hefty 10 ft @9s SSW swell and fresh 21 mph SSW winds making it messy. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 6 ft @10s SW, but the wind picks up to 24 mph WSW, keeping it blown out. On the day after, the swell further decreases to 4 ft @8s SW with 19 mph SSW winds, still not producing anything worthwhile. Best: none.
