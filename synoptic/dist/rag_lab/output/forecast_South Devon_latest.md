Today, South Devon is facing a tough day with 5 ft @7s SW swell and fresh 21 mph SW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve significantly with 5 ft @8s SW swell and light 10 mph SSE winds, creating a clean window at spots like Bovisand Reef and Bantham. The day after, Bantham holds 3 ft @10s SW with light 4 mph NE winds, still offering some fun waves. Best: tomorrow.
