Today in South Devon, conditions are poor with 3 ft @ 6s SW swell and fresh 22 mph SSW winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow, we see an improvement with 4 ft @ 8s SSW swell and lighter 13 mph S winds, offering some workable options at spots like Bovisand Reef and Bantham. The day after, swell increases to 5 ft @ 8s SW, but fresh 21 mph WSW winds will likely keep it messy. Best: tomorrow.
