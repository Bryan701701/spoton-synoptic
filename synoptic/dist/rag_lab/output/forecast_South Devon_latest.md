Today in South Devon, it’s looking great with 4 ft @9s SW swell and light 4 mph ENE winds. Bovisand Reef and Challborough are both clean and fun, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @8s SSW, with fresh 18 mph ESE winds making it a bit choppy—still workable at Challborough and Bantham. Day after, conditions worsen with 3 ft @5s SSE and 9 mph SE winds across the board, so it’s best to give it a miss. Best: today.
