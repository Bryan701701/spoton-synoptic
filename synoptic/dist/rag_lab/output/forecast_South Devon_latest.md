Today in South Devon, Bantham is the spot to be with a fun 3ft @7s SW swell and light 8 mph NNW winds. It’s clean and should hold shape nicely throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2ft @6s with fresh 23 mph SSW winds, making it less inviting. Day after, we see a solid improvement with 4ft @8s SSW swell and light 9 mph SE winds, perfect for a surf session at Bantham, Bovisand Reef, or Challborough. Best: today.
