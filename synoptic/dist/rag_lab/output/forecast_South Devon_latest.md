Today in South Devon, it's looking poor with 5 ft @7s SW swell and fresh 23 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 4 ft @9s SW and light 6 mph E winds, creating clean surf at spots like Bovisand Reef and Challborough. Day after, it drops to 2 ft @8s SW, still clean but smaller, especially at Challborough and Bantham. Best: tomorrow.
