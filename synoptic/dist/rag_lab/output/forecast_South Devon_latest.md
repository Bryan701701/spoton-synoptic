South Devon is looking good today with Bantham offering 3ft @7s SW and light 8 mph NNW winds. It's a great time to hit the water, especially between 08:10 and 16:12. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2ft @6s SW with fresh 23 mph SSW winds, making it less inviting. Day after, we see a solid rebound with 4ft @8s SSW at Bantham and other spots, with light 9 mph SE winds. Best: today.
