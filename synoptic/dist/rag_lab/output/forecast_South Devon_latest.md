Today in South Devon, Bantham is lighting up with a solid 5 ft @ 8s SW swell and light 5 mph WSW winds, making for clean conditions. Tomorrow, expect a drop to 3 ft @ 8s with similar winds, still offering fun waves at Bovisand Reef and Challborough. Day after, the swell picks up slightly to 4 ft @ 8s, with light W winds keeping it workable at all good spots. Best: today.
