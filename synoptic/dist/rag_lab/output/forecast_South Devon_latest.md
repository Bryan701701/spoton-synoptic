Today in South Devon, it's looking poor with 3 ft @5s E swell and fresh 15 mph ENE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 5 ft @7s E, but the wind ramps up to a strong 35 mph NE, keeping conditions messy. On the day after, the swell drops back to 3 ft @5s E with lighter 10 mph E winds, but it remains unworkable. Best: today.
