Today, South Devon is experiencing poor conditions with 4 ft @6s SW swell and fresh 22 mph SW winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell increases slightly to 5 ft @7s SSW, but with even stronger 27 mph S winds, it remains messy. On the day after, conditions improve with 3 ft @7s SSW swell and lighter 11 mph N winds, making for a cleaner surf at spots like Challborough and Bantham. Best: day after.
