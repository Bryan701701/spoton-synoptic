South Devon is lighting up today with 5 ft @8s SSW swell and light 8 mph NW winds. Bovisand Reef, Challborough, and Bantham are all good options, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @10s SW with light NE winds, making Bantham the best pick. By the day after, conditions ease to 4 ft @7s SW, but winds pick up to 13 mph SSW, so expect some chop. Best: today.
