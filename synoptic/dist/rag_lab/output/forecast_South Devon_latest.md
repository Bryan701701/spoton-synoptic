Today in South Devon, it's a bit of a struggle with 6 ft @7s E swell and fresh 13 mph NE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a drop to 3 ft @5s ESE, with lighter 6 mph ENE winds, but still not producing much. The day after, conditions worsen further with 4 ft @6s E swell and strong 29 mph ENE winds, keeping it messy. Best: tomorrow.
