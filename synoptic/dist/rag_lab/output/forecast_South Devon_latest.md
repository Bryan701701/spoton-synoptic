Today in South Devon, it’s looking great with 5 ft @8s SSW swell and light 6 mph S winds. Bovisand Reef and Challborough are both clean and fun, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop significantly with 5 ft @8s SW swell but fresh 27 mph WSW winds will make it blown out. The day after, we’ll see similar 5 ft @7s SSW swell but with 19 mph S winds, keeping it poor. Best: today.
