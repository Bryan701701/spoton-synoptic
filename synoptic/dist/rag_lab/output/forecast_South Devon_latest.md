South Devon is looking solid today with Bantham showing 6 ft @8s SW and light 9 mph W winds. It's clean and fun, especially on the push from 08:51 to 17:16. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @8s SW with fresh 14 mph NW winds, making it less appealing. Day after, conditions worsen with 7 ft @7s SW and strong 33 mph SSW winds, likely blown out. Best: today.
