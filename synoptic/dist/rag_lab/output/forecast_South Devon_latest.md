Today in South Devon, it's looking great with 5 ft @ 8s SSW swell and light 6 mph S winds. Bovisand Reef and Challborough are both firing, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop as fresh 27 mph WSW winds will blow out the surf, making it poor across the board. The day after continues the trend with 5 ft @ 7s SSW swell but still poor due to 19 mph S winds. Best: today.
