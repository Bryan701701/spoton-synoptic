Today in South Devon, conditions are poor with 3 ft @ 6s SW swell and fresh 22 mph SSW winds. Tomorrow, we see a slight improvement with 4 ft @ 8s SSW swell and lighter 13 mph S winds, making it workable at spots like Bovisand Reef. The day after returns to poor conditions with 5 ft @ 8s SW swell but fresh 21 mph WSW winds. Best: tomorrow.
