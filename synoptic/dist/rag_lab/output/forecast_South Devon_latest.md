Today in South Devon, it's a poor surf day with 10 ft @9s WSW swell and fresh 37 mph WSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve with Bantham showing 5 ft @9s SW and light 11 mph SW winds, making it a workable option during the tide window from 08:01 to 16:12. The day after brings 6 ft @9s SW swell with moderate 16 mph SW winds, offering some fun at spots like Bovisand Reef and Challborough. Best: tomorrow.
