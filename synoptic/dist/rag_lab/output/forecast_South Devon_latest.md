Today in South Devon, Bantham is the spot to be with a clean 3ft @7s SW swell and light 8 mph NNW winds. It’s a great time to catch some waves, especially on the mid-tide push. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2ft @6s with fresh 23 mph SSW winds, making it less inviting. Day after, we see a nice rebound with 4ft @8s SSW swell and light 9 mph SE winds at multiple spots, including Bantham and Challborough. Best: day after.
