Today in South Devon, conditions are poor with a swell of 3 ft @ 6s from the ESE and fresh 31 mph E winds creating a blown-out mess. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 2 ft @ 5s, but the NE wind at 12 mph won’t help much either, keeping it choppy. The day after, the swell picks up slightly to 3 ft @ 5s with ENE winds at 13 mph, but it remains poor overall. Best: day after.
