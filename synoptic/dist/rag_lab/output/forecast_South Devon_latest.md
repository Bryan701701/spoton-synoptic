Today in South Devon, conditions are poor with a hefty 6 ft @ 7s WSW swell, but fresh 28 mph WNW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, Bantham shows some promise with a cleaner 3 ft @ 8s SW swell and light 3 mph NE winds, making it a good day to hit the water. The day after, expect a significant increase to 10 ft @ 9s SW, but with 20 mph W winds, it will likely be messy. Best: tomorrow.
