South Devon is looking solid today with 5 ft @8s SSW swell and light 6 mph S winds. Bovisand Reef and Challborough are both clean and fun, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with fresh 27 mph WSW winds making it blown out and poor across all spots. The day after continues the trend with 5 ft @7s SSW swell but still poor due to 19 mph S winds. Best: today.
