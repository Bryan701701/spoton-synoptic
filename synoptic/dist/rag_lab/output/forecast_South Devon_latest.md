Today in South Devon, surf is poor with 3 ft @5s SSW swell but fresh 30 mph SSE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 6 ft @8s SW swell, but winds remain fresh at 25 mph SW, keeping conditions messy. By the day after, conditions get better with 4 ft @9s SW swell and lighter 12 mph S winds, offering some workable waves. Best: day after.
