Today in South Devon, it's a bit rough with 3 ft @5s SSW swell and fresh 30 mph SSE winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees an increase to 6 ft @8s SW, but with 25 mph SW winds, it remains poor. By the day after, conditions improve slightly with 4 ft @9s SW and lighter 12 mph S winds, providing some workable options at spots like Bovisand Reef and Bantham. Best: day after.
