Today in South Devon, it's a tough call with 10 ft @9s WSW swell and fresh 37 mph WSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve with Bantham showing 5 ft @9s SW and lighter 11 mph SW winds, making it a good day to hit the water. On the day after, expect 6 ft @9s SW across the spots with moderate 16 mph SW winds, still workable at times. Best: tomorrow.
