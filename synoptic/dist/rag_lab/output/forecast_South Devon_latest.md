Today in South Devon, conditions are poor with 3 ft @6s SW swell and fresh 22 mph SSW winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 4 ft @8s SSW with lighter 13 mph S winds, making for a more workable day. On the day after, the swell increases to 5 ft @8s SW, but fresh 21 mph WSW winds will likely keep it messy. Best: tomorrow.
