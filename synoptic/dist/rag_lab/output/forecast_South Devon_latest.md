South Devon is looking good today with Bantham offering 4 ft @ 7s SW and a light 12 mph S wind. Best window is from 08:59 to 17:13, so get out there! Tomorrow, conditions drop with 9 ft @ 9s WSW but fresh 38 mph WSW winds will blow it out, making it a no-go. Day after, Bantham picks up again with 5 ft @ 8s SW and lighter 9 mph SW winds, providing a fun session. Best: today.
