South Devon is looking great today with 4 ft @9s SW swell and light 4 mph ENE winds. Bovisand Reef and Challborough are both clean and fun, especially during the mid-tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @8s SSW with fresh 18 mph ESE winds, making it a bit choppy. Day after, conditions worsen further with 3 ft @5s SSE swell and 9 mph SE winds, so it’s best to give it a miss. Best: today.
