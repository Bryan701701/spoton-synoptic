South Devon is lighting up today with a solid 5 ft @8s SSW swell and light 8 mph NW winds. Bovisand Reef, Challborough, and Bantham are all working well, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @10s SW with light NE winds, making Bantham the best bet. On the day after, conditions ease a bit with 4 ft @7s SW and fresh 13 mph SSW winds, but it may be a bit choppy. Best: today.
