Today in South Devon, it's looking poor with 3 ft @5s ESE swell and fresh 17 mph ENE winds. Tomorrow, the swell picks up slightly to 4 ft @5s E but the wind increases to 25 mph ENE, making it quite blown out. On the day after, conditions remain similar with 3 ft @6s ESE swell and 24 mph ENE winds, still not producing. Best: today.
