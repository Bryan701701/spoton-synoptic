Today in South Devon, conditions are poor with a swell of 4 ft @ 5s from the E and fresh 17 mph ENE winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight increase to 5 ft @ 6s with moderate 12 mph E winds, still not producing much fun. By the day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 5s with light 4 mph ENE winds, keeping it quiet. Best: tomorrow.
