Today in South Devon, it’s looking poor with 6 ft @9s SW swell and fresh 26 mph SW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow ramps up to 11 ft @9s SSW, but with even stronger 36 mph SSW winds, it’ll be messy. Day after, conditions improve slightly to 6 ft @10s SW with 17 mph SW winds, making it more workable during the tide windows. Best: day after.
