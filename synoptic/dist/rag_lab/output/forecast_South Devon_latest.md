Today in South Devon, the surf is on the smaller side at 3 ft @ 5s with fresh 13 mph NE winds creating some chop. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with similar 3 ft @ 6s swell but stronger 26 mph ENE winds, making it quite blown out. By the day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 6s with lighter 12 mph NE winds, still not producing much. Best: today.
