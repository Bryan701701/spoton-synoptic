South Devon is looking solid today with 5 ft @8s SW swell and fresh 13 mph SSW winds. Bovisand Reef, Challborough, and Bantham are all working well, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 4 ft @9s with a moderate 14 mph NW wind, still offering some fun waves. By the day after, conditions ease with 3 ft @8s and light 5 mph ENE winds, making Bantham the top pick. Best: today.
