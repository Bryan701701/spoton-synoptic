Today in South Devon, we’ve got a solid 5 ft @8s SW swell with fresh 13 mph SSW winds. Bovisand Reef and Challborough are both clean and working well, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @9s with moderate NW winds, still offering some fun at the same spots. By the day after, the surf eases to 3 ft @8s, but Bantham will be the pick with lighter ENE winds. Best: today.
