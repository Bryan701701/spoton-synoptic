Today in South Devon, Bantham is lighting up with a clean 3ft @10s SW swell and light 6 mph WSW winds. Perfect for a fun session during the tide window from 08:07 to 16:11. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4ft @6s with fresh 21 mph SW winds, making it less appealing. Day after, the swell picks up to 5ft @7s but with 17 mph S winds, offering some workable options.
