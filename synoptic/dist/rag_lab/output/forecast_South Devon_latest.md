Today in South Devon, conditions are poor with a hefty 10 ft @9s SSW swell, but fresh 21 mph SSW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a drop to 6 ft @10s SW, still with strong 24 mph WSW winds, keeping it messy. By the day after, the swell drops further to 4 ft @8s SW, with slightly lighter 19 mph SSW winds, but it remains poor overall. Best: day after.
