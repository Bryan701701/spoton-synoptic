Today in South Devon, conditions are poor with a fresh 23 mph SSW wind creating a blown-out scene at Bovisand Reef, Challborough, and Bantham, all showing 5 ft @ 7s SW. Tomorrow brings a nice change with 4 ft @ 9s SW and light 6 mph E winds, making it a great day at Bovisand Reef, Challborough, and Bantham from 08:13 to 16:14. The day after, expect smaller surf at 2 ft @ 8s SW with light NE winds, still workable at Challborough and Bantham during the same tide window. Best: tomorrow.
