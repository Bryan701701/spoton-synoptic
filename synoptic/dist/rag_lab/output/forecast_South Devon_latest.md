Today in South Devon, Bantham is the spot to be with clean 2 ft @ 5s SW and a light 9 mph NW wind. It’s a great time to hit the water, especially between 08:14 and 16:29. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 3 ft @ 6s WSW, still fun at Bantham with a moderate 11 mph W wind. On the day after, expect 5 ft @ 8s WSW, but the fresh 17 mph WNW wind may make it a bit choppy. Best: today.
