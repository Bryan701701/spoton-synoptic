Today in South Devon, it's flat with no surf to speak of—wrong swell angle and light winds. Tomorrow, a small bump to 2 ft @5s with fresh 26 mph NW winds, making for blown-out conditions. Day after, still 2 ft @6s but with light 5 mph WSW winds, offering a better chance for some clean waves. Best: day after.
