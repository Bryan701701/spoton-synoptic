Today in South Devon, conditions are poor with 4 ft @6s SW swell and fresh 22 mph SW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight increase to 5 ft @7s SSW, but the fresh 27 mph S winds will keep it messy. By the day after, conditions improve with 3 ft @7s SSW and lighter 11 mph N winds, making for a cleaner surf at spots like Challborough and Bantham. Best: day after.
