Today in South Devon, Bantham is lighting up with a fun 3ft @10s SW swell and light 6 mph WSW winds. It's a great day to hit the water, especially during the tide window from 08:07 to 16:11. Tomorrow, conditions drop with a messy 4ft @6s SW swell and fresh 21 mph SW winds, making it less appealing. On the day after, things improve slightly with 5ft @7s SSW swell and 17 mph S winds, offering some workable options. Best: today.
