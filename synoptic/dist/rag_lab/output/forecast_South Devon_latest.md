Today in South Devon, conditions are poor with 5 ft @7s SSW swell, but fresh 24 mph S winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, Bantham lights up with 3 ft @8s WSW and light 6 mph NW winds, offering a fun day on the water. The day after, conditions drop to 2 ft @6s SW with fresh 19 mph SSW winds, keeping it messy. Best: tomorrow.
