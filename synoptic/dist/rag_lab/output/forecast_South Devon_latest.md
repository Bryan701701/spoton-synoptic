South Devon is lighting up today with 4 ft @9s SW swell and light 4 mph ENE winds. Bovisand Reef and Challborough are both clean and fun, especially during the tide push from 08:13 to 16:14. Tomorrow sees a drop to 2 ft @8s SSW with fresh 18 mph ESE winds, making it a bit choppy at Challborough and Bantham. Day after, conditions worsen further with 3 ft @5s SSE and 9 mph SE winds across the board. Best: today.
