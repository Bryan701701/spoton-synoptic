Today in South Devon, conditions are poor with a swell of 5 ft @ 7s SW and fresh 21 mph SW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell improves to 5 ft @ 8s SW with lighter 10 mph SSE winds, creating good conditions at spots like Bovisand Reef and Bantham during the mid-tide windows. The day after, Bantham offers 3 ft @ 10s SW with gentle 4 mph NE winds, still workable but less powerful. Best: tomorrow.
