Today in South Devon, Bantham is the spot to be with a solid 4 ft @ 7s SW swell and light S winds at 12 mph, making for clean conditions. Tomorrow, expect a significant increase in swell to 9 ft @ 9s WSW, but fresh 38 mph WSW winds will make it blown out across the region. On the day after, Bantham returns to form with 5 ft @ 8s SW and lighter 9 mph SW winds, creating a fun surf day. Best: today.
