Today in South Devon, it's looking poor with 5 ft @7s SW swell but fresh 21 mph SW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow brings a solid improvement with 5 ft @8s SW, light 10 mph SSE winds, and workable conditions at spots like Bovisand Reef and Bantham. Day after, Bantham holds 3 ft @10s SW with light 4 mph NE winds, still offering some fun. Best: tomorrow.
