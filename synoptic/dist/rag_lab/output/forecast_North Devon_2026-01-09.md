North Devon is facing a tough stretch. Today, it's 5 ft @7s NW with fresh 23 mph NW winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 5 ft @9s W and winds picking up to 25 mph NW, still not producing anything worthwhile. By the day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @7s SW, but the fresh SSE wind keeps it choppy. Best: none.
