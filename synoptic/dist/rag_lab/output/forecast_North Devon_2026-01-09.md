Today in North Devon, conditions are poor with 5 ft @7s NW swell, but fresh 23 mph NW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow sees similar conditions with 5 ft @9s W swell and 25 mph NW winds, keeping it messy. Day after drops to 2 ft @7s SW, still with fresh 23 mph SSE winds, making it less than ideal. Best: none.
