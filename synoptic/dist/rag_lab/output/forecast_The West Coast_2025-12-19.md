Today on the West Coast, it's a tough call with 9 ft @12s W swell and fresh 27 mph SW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly to 5 ft @11s WNW with moderate 18 mph SSE winds, but still not ideal. The day after, we see a similar 5 ft @14s WNW swell, but fresh 32 mph ESE winds will keep it choppy. Best: tomorrow.
