Today in Caithness, it's looking solid with 3 ft @ 8s NNW swell across the board. Winds are fresh at 15 mph SSE, so expect some chop, but sheltered spots like Point of Ness and Dunnet Bay should still be fun. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 3 ft @ 7s NNW, but winds pick up to 16 mph ESE, making it a bit more challenging. By the day after, conditions improve with 3 ft @ 7s E swell and lighter winds at 12 mph SW, making it a great day to hit the waves. Best: day after.
