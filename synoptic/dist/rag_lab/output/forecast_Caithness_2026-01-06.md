Today in Caithness, we're seeing some fun 3 ft @ 8s NNW swell with a fresh 15 mph SSE wind. Sheltered corners like Point of Ness and Dunnet Bay are working well, so get out there! Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 3 ft @ 7s NNW swell, but the wind shifts to a stronger 16 mph ESE, making it a bit choppy. On the day after, expect a nice improvement with 3 ft @ 7s E swell and lighter 12 mph SW winds, perfect for a surf session. Best: day after.
