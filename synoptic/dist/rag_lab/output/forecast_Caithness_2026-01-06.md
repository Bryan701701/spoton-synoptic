Today in Caithness, we're looking at a fun 3ft @8s NNW swell with a fresh 15 mph SSE wind. Sheltered corners like Point of Ness and Dunnet Bay are working well, so grab your board! Tomorrow, the swell holds at 3ft but shifts to a shorter period of 7s with a stronger 16 mph ESE wind, making it a bit choppy. The day after, conditions improve with a solid 3ft @7s E swell and lighter 12 mph SW winds, offering some good opportunities at spots like Ackergill and Sinclair's Bay. Best: day after.
