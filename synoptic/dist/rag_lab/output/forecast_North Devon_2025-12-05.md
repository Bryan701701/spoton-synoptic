Today in North Devon, it's looking great with 4 ft @ 11s W swell and light 11 mph SSE winds. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are solid picks, especially with Lynmouth's tide window from 08:03–16:08. Tomorrow, conditions take a turn for the worse with 8 ft @ 11s W swell and fresh 29 mph WSW winds, making it blown out across the region. On the day after, expect 5 ft @ 11s WSW with 14 mph SE winds, offering some workable surf at spots like Croyde Beach and Woolacombe. Best: today.
