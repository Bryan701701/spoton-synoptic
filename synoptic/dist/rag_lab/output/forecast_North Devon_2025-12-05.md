Today in North Devon, it's looking solid with 4 ft @ 11s W swell and light SSE winds at 11 mph. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are great picks, especially with Lynmouth's tide peaking from 09:03 to 17:08. Tomorrow, conditions drop as the swell jumps to 8 ft @ 11s W but with fresh 29 mph WSW winds, making it blown out and poor for surfing. On the day after, surf settles back to 5 ft @ 11s WSW with more manageable 14 mph SE winds, making it workable at spots like Woolacombe and Croyde Beach. Best: today.
