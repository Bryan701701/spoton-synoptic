Today on the Causeway Coast, conditions are poor with 4 ft @8s WSW swell and fresh 25 mph S winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 8 ft @15s WNW, but with 19 mph S winds, it's still not producing well. The day after, the swell remains at 8 ft @12s W, but the fresh 31 mph SW winds will keep it messy. Best: tomorrow.
