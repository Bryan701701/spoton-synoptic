Today in Donegal, it’s a bit of a struggle with poor conditions. The swell is 6 ft @ 8s WSW, but fresh 24 mph SSE winds are making it blown out across the spots. Tomorrow sees a slight increase in swell to 7 ft @ 8s W, but the wind remains fresh at 21 mph from the south, keeping it messy. By the day after, conditions improve significantly with clean 8 ft @ 11s NW swell and light 5 mph ESE winds, making it a great day to hit the water. Best: day after.
