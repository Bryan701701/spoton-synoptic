Today in South Devon, it's a bit rough with 7 ft @7s SSW swell and fresh 21 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow brings a nice change with 4 ft @8s SW swell and light 9 mph SW winds, perfect for a fun session at spots like Bovisand Reef or Bantham. Day after, Bantham holds 5 ft @8s SW with light 4 mph WSW winds, still offering some good waves. Best: tomorrow.
