Today in County Clare, it’s a no-go with 11 ft @ 13s W swell and fresh 30 mph WSW winds creating a blown-out scene. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @ 9s W with moderate 21 mph SSE winds, still not producing much. By the day after, conditions improve significantly with 11 ft @ 15s W and light 3 mph SSE winds, making for some fun waves at spots like Crab Island and Doolin Point. Best: day after.
