Today in County Clare, it's a challenging surf day with 11 ft @ 13s W swell and fresh 30 mph WSW winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow sees a drop to 4 ft @ 9s W with moderate 21 mph SSE winds, still not ideal. By the day after, conditions improve significantly with 11 ft @ 15s W swell and light 3 mph SSE winds, offering clean and fun waves at spots like Doolin Point and Crab Island. Best: day after.
