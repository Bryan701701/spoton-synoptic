Today in South Devon, it's looking poor with 5 ft @7s SW swell but fresh 23 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 4 ft @9s SW swell and light 6 mph E winds, offering a clean window from 08:13 to 16:14. The day after, swell drops to 2 ft @8s SW with light NE winds, still workable at Challborough and Bantham during the same tide window. Best: tomorrow.
