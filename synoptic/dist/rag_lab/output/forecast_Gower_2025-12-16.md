Today, Gower is looking solid with 4ft @12s W swell and fresh 15 mph NNW winds. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are your best bets, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 4ft @9s WSW swell and fresh 26 mph S winds, making it blown out and poor across the board. Day after, expect 6ft @12s WSW swell with lighter 12 mph S winds, offering a much better surf day at spots like Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach. Best: day after.
