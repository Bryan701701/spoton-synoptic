Today in Moray, it’s flat with no surf on the horizon—swell isn’t getting in and the wind is light. Tomorrow looks similar, with no change in conditions. Day after, we see a nice shift with 2 ft @7s NE swell and light WSW winds, making for fun, clean waves at spots like Fraserburgh and Banff. Best: day after.
