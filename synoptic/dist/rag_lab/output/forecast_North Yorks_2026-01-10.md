North Yorks is looking solid today with 5 ft @8s ENE swell and fresh 14 mph ENE winds. Good spots like Withernsea and Filey are working well, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @6s with fresh 28 mph SSE winds, making it a poor day for surf. The day after continues the trend with 2 ft @6s, still blown out by 18 mph SSW winds. Best: today.
