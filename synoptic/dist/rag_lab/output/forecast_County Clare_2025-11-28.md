Today in County Clare, it's a solid 9 ft @ 13s W with fresh 17 mph W winds. Clean conditions at sheltered spots like Crab Island and Doolin Point, especially during the best tide windows. Tomorrow sees a drop to 6 ft @ 11s W, but still workable with lighter 12 mph N winds. By the day after, conditions ease further to 3 ft @ 9s W, making for fun, longboard-friendly waves. Best: today.
