Today in Donegal, it's a quiet one with no surf action—wrong swell angle and fresh SSE winds have it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve with a solid 6 ft @15s W swell and light E winds at spots like Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand, offering good surf from early morning through the afternoon. The day after, expect similar 6 ft @12s W conditions, with a bit more consistency at places like Magheroaty Beach. Best: tomorrow.
