Today in Donegal, it's a bit of a bummer with conditions not producing—7 ft @11s W swell meets fresh 28 mph SSE winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow, things improve as Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand light up with 6 ft @15s W and light 11 mph E winds—perfect for a fun session. Day after, expect similar conditions with 6 ft @12s W, but keep an eye on the wind. Best: tomorrow.
