Today in South Devon, Bantham is looking solid with 4 ft @ 7s SW and a light 12 mph S wind, making for clean conditions. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 9 ft @ 9s WSW, but fresh 38 mph WSW winds will blow it out, so best to give it a miss. On the day after, Bantham returns to form with 5 ft @ 8s SW and a lighter 9 mph SW wind, offering a fun session. Best: today.
