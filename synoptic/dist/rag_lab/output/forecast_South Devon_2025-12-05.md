Today in South Devon, Bantham is the spot to be with a solid 4ft @7s SW swell and a light 12 mph S wind, making for clean conditions. Tomorrow, expect a significant increase in swell to 9ft @9s WSW, but with fresh 38 mph WSW winds, it’ll be blown out across the board. On the day after, Bantham returns to form with 5ft @8s SW and lighter 9 mph SW winds, offering a better chance for fun waves. Best: today.
