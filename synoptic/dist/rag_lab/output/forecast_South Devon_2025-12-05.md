Today in South Devon, Bantham is the spot to be with a solid 4 ft @ 7s SW swell and light 12 mph S winds, making for clean conditions. Tomorrow, conditions take a turn as the swell ramps up to 9 ft @ 9s WSW, but fresh 38 mph WSW winds will blow it out across the region. On the day after, Bantham bounces back with 5 ft @ 8s SW and lighter 9 mph SW winds, offering a better chance for fun waves. Best: today.
