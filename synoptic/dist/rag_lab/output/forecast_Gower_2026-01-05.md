Today in Gower, it's a bit slow with 2 ft @5s WNW swell and light 5 mph N winds. Not much happening, so it’s a quiet day. Tomorrow drops to 1 ft @5s with fresh 26 mph WNW winds, making it blown out and not producing. Day after brings a solid 4 ft @6s W swell with 15 mph NW winds; it should be more fun, but check for conditions. Best: day after.
