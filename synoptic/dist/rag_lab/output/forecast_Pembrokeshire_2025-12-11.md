Today in Pembrokeshire, conditions are poor with 5 ft @9s SW swell and fresh 30 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, things improve significantly with 5 ft @13s WSW swell and light 8 mph WSW winds, creating clean and fun surf across spots like Whitesands Bay and Freshwater West. The day after, surf remains at 5 ft but with a slightly shorter period of 10s and freshening winds at 13 mph SW, still offering workable conditions. Best: tomorrow.
