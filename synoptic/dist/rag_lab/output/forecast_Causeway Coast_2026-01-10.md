Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking good with 4 ft @11s WNW swell and light 9 mph SSE winds. White Park Bay and Portballintrae are your best bets, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @6s S with fresh 24 mph S winds, making it poor across the board. The day after, similar 4 ft @7s SW swell but with even stronger 26 mph S winds, keeping it messy. Best: today.
