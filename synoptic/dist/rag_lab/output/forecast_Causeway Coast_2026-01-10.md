Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking good with 4 ft @11s WNW swell and light 9 mph SSE winds. White Park Bay and Portballintrae are your best bets, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @6s S with fresh 24 mph winds, making it poor across the board. Day after, similar story with 4 ft @7s SW but stronger 26 mph winds, keeping it blown out. Best: today.
