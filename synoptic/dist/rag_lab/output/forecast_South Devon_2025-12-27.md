Today in South Devon, conditions are poor with 4 ft @5s E swell and fresh 17 mph ENE winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 5 ft @6s E swell and moderate 12 mph E winds, but still not producing anything worthwhile. By the day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @5s ESE with light 4 mph ENE winds, keeping it quiet. Best: tomorrow.
