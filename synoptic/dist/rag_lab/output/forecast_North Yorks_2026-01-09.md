Today in North Yorks, conditions are poor with 4 ft @6s ENE swell and fresh 21 mph NE winds. It's blown out across the board, so best to give it a miss. Tomorrow sees an improvement with 6 ft @8s ENE swell and lighter 13 mph ENE winds, making it workable at spots like Filey and Whitby Beach during the mid-tide. The day after drops to 3 ft @6s with 16 mph S winds, still offering some fun at sheltered spots. Best: tomorrow.
