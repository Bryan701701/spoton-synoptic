Today in North Yorks, conditions are poor with 4 ft @6s ENE swell and fresh 21 mph NE wind. It's blown out, so best to give it a miss. Tomorrow sees an improvement with 6 ft @8s ENE swell and lighter 13 mph ENE wind, offering some workable options at spots like Filey and Whitby Beach during the tide windows. The day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @6s E with 16 mph S winds, still providing some fun at sheltered corners. Best: tomorrow.
