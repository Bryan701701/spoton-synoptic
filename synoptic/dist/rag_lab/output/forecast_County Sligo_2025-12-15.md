County Sligo is looking solid today with 4 ft @ 11s WNW swell and light 7 mph S winds. Strandhill and Easkey spots are clean and fun, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 6 ft @ 12s WNW swell but fresh 20 mph SSW winds will make it blown out. The day after, similar conditions persist with 4 ft @ 9s WSW swell and 19 mph S winds, keeping it poor across the board. Best: today.
