Today in North Devon, conditions are poor with 3 ft @5s NW swell and fresh 23 mph NW wind, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees similar 3 ft @5s NNW swell but with lighter 8 mph NNE winds, offering a slight improvement. Day after drops to 2 ft @5s NW with 10 mph N winds, still not ideal. Best: tomorrow.
