Today in North Devon, it's a bit of a struggle with 3 ft @5s NW swell and fresh 23 mph NW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees similar conditions with the same swell size but lighter 8 mph NNE winds, still not producing much. Day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @5s NW with 10 mph N winds, keeping it on the quiet side. Best: tomorrow.
