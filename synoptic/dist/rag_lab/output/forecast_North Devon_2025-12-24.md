Today in North Devon, conditions are pretty poor with 3 ft @6s ENE swell and a fresh 13 mph ENE wind. Tomorrow stays similar, with the swell dropping to 3 ft @5s but winds picking up to 21 mph NE, making it blown out. The day after, the swell continues to fade to 2 ft @4s, still with a fresh 16 mph ENE wind. Best: today.
