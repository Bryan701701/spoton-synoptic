Today in North Devon, it's a bit of a struggle with 3 ft @6s ENE swell and fresh 13 mph ENE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions worsen as the swell drops to 3 ft @5s with stronger 21 mph NE winds, keeping it messy. The day after, we see even smaller waves at 2 ft @4s, still with fresh ENE winds, so not much is happening. Best: today.
