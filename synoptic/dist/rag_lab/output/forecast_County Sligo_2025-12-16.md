Today in County Sligo, surf is on with 6 ft @12s WNW and fresh 17 mph SSW winds. Strandhill and Easkey spots are clean and fun, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow sees a drop to 4 ft @10s, and the fresh S wind will make it blown out across the board. Day after, the swell picks up to 10 ft @16s WNW, but the fresh S wind will still create some challenges. Best: today.
