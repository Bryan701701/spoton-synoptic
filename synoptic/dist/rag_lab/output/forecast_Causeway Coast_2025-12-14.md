Today on the Causeway Coast, White Park Bay and Portballintrae are offering 4ft @10s W with fresh 17 mph SSW winds. Expect some chop, but sheltered corners are still workable. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 4ft @11s WNW and light 7 mph S winds, making it a great day for a session. The day after, it gets even better with 5ft @12s WNW and similar light winds. Best: tomorrow.
