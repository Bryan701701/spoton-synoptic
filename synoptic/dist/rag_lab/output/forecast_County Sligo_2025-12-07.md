Today in County Sligo, Strandhill and Easkey Left are working with 3 ft @10s WNW swell and a fresh 17 mph SE wind. Expect some fun rides, especially during the tide push from 08:40 to 16:12. Tomorrow, conditions drop with the same swell size but a shorter period and onshore winds, making it less appealing. The day after, the swell increases to 4 ft @10s, but strong 26 mph S winds will likely blow it out. Best: today.
