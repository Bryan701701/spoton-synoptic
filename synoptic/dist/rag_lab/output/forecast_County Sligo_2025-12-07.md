Today in County Sligo, you’ll find some fun options with 3 ft @10s WNW swell at Strandhill and Easkey Left, both working well despite a fresh 17 mph SE wind. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @9s with the same wind, but it’s looking poor overall. Day after, the swell picks up slightly to 4 ft @10s, but strong 26 mph S winds will likely make it messy. Best: today.
