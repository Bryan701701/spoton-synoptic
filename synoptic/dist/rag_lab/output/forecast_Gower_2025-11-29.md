Today in Gower, we're looking at solid surf with a consistent 5 ft @9s WSW swell and light NW winds at 8 mph. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are both firing, with the best windows running throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @9s, still clean but less powerful, with similar NW winds. Day after, conditions take a turn for the worse with 7 ft @7s SW swell and strong 39 mph SSW winds, making it poor across the board. Best: today.
