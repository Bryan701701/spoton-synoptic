Today, Gower is lighting up with clean 5 ft @9s WSW swell and light NW winds at 8 mph. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are prime spots, offering fun conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @9s but remains consistent across the same locations, still with light NW winds. On the day after, conditions turn poor with 7 ft @7s SW swell and strong 39 mph SSW winds, making it blown out everywhere. Best: today.
