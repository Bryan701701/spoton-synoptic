Today on the East Coast, conditions are poor with 5 ft @6s S swell and fresh 23 mph SSW winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @5s SSW with similar winds, still not producing anything worthwhile. By the day after, the swell remains at 3 ft @6s SSE, but wind eases to 14 mph S, offering some workable options at spots like Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay during the mid-tide window. Best: day after.
