Today on the East Coast, conditions are poor with a consistent 5 ft @6s S swell and fresh 23 mph SSW winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 3 ft @5s SSW, but the same fresh winds keep it messy and unworkable. By the day after, the swell remains at 3 ft @6s SSE, with winds easing to 14 mph S, offering a bit more potential at spots like Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay during the mid-tide. Best: day after.
