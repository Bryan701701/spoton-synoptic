Today in North Devon, it's a bit of a washout with fresh 30 mph NW winds making for blown-out conditions across the board. Tomorrow, things improve with 3 ft @ 6s WNW and light 6 mph SSW winds, making spots like Woolacombe and Putsborough workable. The day after, expect 6 ft @ 7s WNW but with fresh 26 mph NW winds, leading to messy surf again. Best: tomorrow.
