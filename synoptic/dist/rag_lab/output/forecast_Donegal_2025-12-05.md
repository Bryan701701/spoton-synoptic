Today in Donegal, it's a solid day with 7 ft @14s W swell and light SE winds at 12 mph. Great spots like Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand are working well, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions remain good with 7 ft @13s WSW swell and lighter winds at 11 mph, perfect for places like Magheroaty Beach and Bloody Foreland. On the day after, the swell drops slightly to 6 ft @11s, but still offers fun waves at several spots. Best: today.
