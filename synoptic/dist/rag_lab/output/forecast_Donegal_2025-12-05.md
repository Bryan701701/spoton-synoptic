Today in Donegal, it's looking great with 7 ft @ 14s W swell and light SE winds at 12 mph. Spots like Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand are clean and fun, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions remain solid with 7 ft @ 13s WSW swell and light SSW winds, making it a good day for places like Magheroaty Beach and Bloody Foreland. On the day after, the swell drops to 6 ft @ 11s W with SSE winds, still offering some workable options at sheltered spots. Best: tomorrow.
