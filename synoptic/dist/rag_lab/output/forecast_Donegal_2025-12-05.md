Today in Donegal, it's looking solid with 7 ft @ 14s W swell and light SE winds at 12 mph. Great options at Rossnowlagh, Tullan Strand, and The Peak, all working well throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 7 ft @ 13s WSW with SSW winds at 11 mph, still offering fun rides at spots like Magheroaty Beach and Bloody Foreland. On the day after, expect 6 ft @ 11s W with SSE winds, keeping it workable at various spots but a bit less punchy. Best: today.
