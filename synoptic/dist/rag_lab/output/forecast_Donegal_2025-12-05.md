Today in Donegal, it's looking solid with 7 ft @ 14s W swell and light SE winds at 12 mph. Great conditions at spots like Rossnowlagh and The Peak, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @ 11s, but still some fun to be had at sheltered corners. By the day after, expect 6 ft @ 11s with SSE winds, keeping it workable at places like Magheroaty Beach. Best: today.
