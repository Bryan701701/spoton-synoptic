Today, the Causeway Coast is showing some fun with 3 ft @9s WNW swell and fresh 13 mph WNW winds. White Park Bay and Portballintrae are your best bets, especially during the tide window from 08:49 to 16:16. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 4 ft @10s WNW swell and lighter 12 mph WNW winds, making for a solid day at the same spots. On the day after, expect similar 4 ft @11s WNW swell, but with fresh 15 mph SE winds, so look for sheltered corners. Best: tomorrow.
