Today in Sutherland, it's a no-go with flat conditions at 0 ft and no swell hitting the coast. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 7 ft @10s from the W, but fresh 31 mph SW winds will keep it blown out across the region. Day after, conditions improve with 6 ft @11s W swell and lighter 17 mph SSW winds, making for some clean options at spots like Sango Bay and Melvich. Best: day after.
