Today in Sutherland, it's a quiet one with no surf action—wrong swell angle and fresh SW winds at 32 mph. Tomorrow, conditions remain poor with a similar setup: 7 ft @10s W swell and 31 mph SW winds. Day after brings a shift, as the swell holds at 6 ft @11s with lighter 17 mph SSW winds, making for some workable waves at spots like Sango Bay. Best: day after.
