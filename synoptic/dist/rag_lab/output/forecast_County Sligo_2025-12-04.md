Today in County Sligo, it's looking great with 5 ft @ 11s WNW swell and light 7 mph SSW winds. Strandhill and Easkey spots are clean and fun, especially on the push. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 7 ft @ 14s WNW but with fresh 20 mph SSE winds, making it blown out across the board. Day after, surf eases to 3 ft @ 12s WNW with 16 mph W winds, workable mainly at Strandhill. Best: today.
