Today in Sutherland, it's looking good with 4 ft @9s N swell and fresh 14 mph SSW winds. Melvich and Strathy are prime spots, especially early on the tide. Tomorrow, conditions improve with swell building to 5 ft @7s N and lighter 10 mph SE winds, making for fun surf. The day after, expect 3 ft @9s NW with moderate SSE winds, still offering some playful waves. Best: tomorrow.
