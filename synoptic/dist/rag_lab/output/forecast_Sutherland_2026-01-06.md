Today in Sutherland, surf is looking solid at 4 ft @9s from the N with a fresh 14 mph SSW wind. Good spots like Melvich and Strathy are working well, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, expect a bit more size at 5 ft @7s, with a lighter 10 mph SE wind, keeping conditions clean and fun. The day after, surf drops to 3 ft @9s with a moderate SSE breeze, still offering some workable waves. Best: tomorrow.
