Sutherland is looking solid today with 4 ft @9s N swell and fresh 14 mph SSW winds. Melvich and Strathy are your top picks, both offering clean conditions early. Tomorrow, expect a bit of a bump to 5 ft @7s N with lighter 10 mph SE winds, keeping it fun throughout the day. The day after, swell drops to 3 ft @9s NW, still workable at the sheltered spots. Best: tomorrow.
