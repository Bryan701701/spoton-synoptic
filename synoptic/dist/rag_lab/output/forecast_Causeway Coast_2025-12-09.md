Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking poor with 2 ft @5s ESE and fresh 36 mph ESE winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 4 ft @8s W swell but still fresh 34 mph SW winds, keeping it messy. Day after, the swell drops slightly to 3 ft @8s W with easing 28 mph SSE winds, but it’s still not producing. Best: day after.
