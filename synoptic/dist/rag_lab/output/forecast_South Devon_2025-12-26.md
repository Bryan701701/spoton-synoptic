Today in South Devon, it's looking poor with 3 ft @5s ESE swell and fresh 17 mph ENE wind. Tomorrow sees a slight increase to 4 ft @5s, but the fresh 25 mph ENE wind will keep it blown out. On the day after, conditions remain similar with 3 ft @6s ESE and 24 mph ENE wind, still not producing well. Best: today.
