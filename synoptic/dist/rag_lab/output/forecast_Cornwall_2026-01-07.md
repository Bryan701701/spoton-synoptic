Today, conditions are poor across Cornwall with fresh NW winds at 30 mph creating blown-out surf. The swell is 5 ft @ 6s from the WNW, but it's not producing any workable waves. Tomorrow, things improve significantly with cleaner conditions and a swell of 4 ft @ 7s, light WSW winds, and plenty of options at spots like Crantock and Fistral. The day after, expect a larger swell at 7 ft @ 8s, but with fresh NW winds likely making it messy again. Best: tomorrow.
