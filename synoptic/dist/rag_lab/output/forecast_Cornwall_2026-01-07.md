Today, Cornwall is experiencing fresh onshore winds at 30 mph, making conditions blown out across all coasts. The swell is 5 ft @ 6s from the WNW, but with the wind on it, it's not producing any workable surf. Tomorrow looks promising with a shift to lighter winds and cleaner conditions. Day after, expect bigger swell but still challenging due to fresh winds. Best: tomorrow.
