Today in Sutherland, surf is clean and fun at 2 ft @ 11s W with light SSE winds. Good spots like Melvich and Strathy are working well, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, we see a solid increase to 5 ft @ 13s WNW with light S winds, making it a great day for some bigger waves. On the day after, conditions remain strong at 4 ft @ 12s WNW, with similar light winds, keeping the surf lively. Best: tomorrow.
