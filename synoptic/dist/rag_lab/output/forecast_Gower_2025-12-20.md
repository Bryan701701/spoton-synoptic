Today in Gower, it's a bit of a bummer with 5 ft @9s WSW swell but fresh 21 mph SSE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve significantly with 5 ft @12s WSW swell and light 10 mph SE winds, offering clean surf at spots like Llangennith Beach. The day after continues the trend with 4 ft @11s WSW swell and light 9 mph ESE winds, keeping it fun at various beaches. Best: tomorrow.
