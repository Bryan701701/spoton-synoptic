Today in Gower, the surf is flat with no swell hitting the coast. Tomorrow, conditions improve with a solid 5 ft @12s WSW swell and light 10 mph SE winds, making for clean waves at spots like Llangennith Beach. The day after, the swell eases slightly to 4 ft @11s WSW, still fun with light ESE winds. Best: tomorrow.
