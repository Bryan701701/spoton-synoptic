Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a solid 4 ft @ 9s SW with light 6 mph N winds, making for clean conditions at spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay. Tomorrow, expect similar swell but with a longer period of 12s, still holding at 4 ft and light NNW winds—great for a fun session. Day after, the wind picks up to 28 mph SSW, making it blown out and poor across the region. Best: today.
