Today on Gower, it's not producing with 3 ft @5s E swell and fresh 24 mph E winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow drops to 1 ft @6s SE with 31 mph E winds, so expect very small and choppy conditions. Day after sees a slight improvement with 3 ft @5s E swell and lighter 13 mph ENE winds, but still not ideal. Best: day after.
