The East Coast is looking fun today with 4 ft @ 6s SSE at Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay, both holding shape under a fresh 15 mph SSW wind. Tomorrow drops to 2 ft @ 5s, with the wind picking up to 20 mph, making it a poor day for surf. Day after sees a slight improvement to 3 ft @ 5s, but still on the lower end. Best: today.
