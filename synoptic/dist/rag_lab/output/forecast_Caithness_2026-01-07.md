Today in Caithness, it's looking fun with 3 ft @ 8s N swell and light 10 mph E winds. Point of Ness and Dunnet Bay are both clean and working well. Tomorrow, conditions shift slightly with 3 ft @ 8s ESE swell and 10 mph SSE winds, keeping options open at spots like Ackergill and Sinclair's Bay. By the day after, expect a similar vibe with 3 ft @ 7s SE swell, but winds lighten to 5 mph ESE, making for a pleasant surf day. Best: today.
