Today in Caithness, it's looking fun with 3 ft @ 8s N swell and light 10 mph E winds. Spots like Point of Ness and Dunnet Bay are clean and working well. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 3 ft @ 8s ESE, with similar light winds, making for another good day at places like Ackergill and Sinclair's Bay. The day after, expect 3 ft @ 7s SE, with light winds again, keeping the surf consistent. Best: tomorrow.
