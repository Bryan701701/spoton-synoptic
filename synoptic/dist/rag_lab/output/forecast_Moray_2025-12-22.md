Today in Moray, it's looking good with 2 ft @5s E swell and moderate 11 mph ESE winds. Fraserburgh and Pennan are your best bets, both offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, swell picks up slightly to 3 ft @7s E, but winds freshen to 16 mph SSE, making it a bit choppy. The day after, conditions drop to 1 ft @7s E with light winds, leaving it quite flat. Best: today.
