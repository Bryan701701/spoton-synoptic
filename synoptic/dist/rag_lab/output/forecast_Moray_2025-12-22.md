Today in Moray, surf is clean and fun at 2 ft @5s with a light ESE wind at 11 mph. Fraserburgh and Pennan are your best bets, working nicely on the push from 08:50 to 15:23. Tomorrow, expect a bump to 3 ft @7s but with fresh SSE winds at 16 mph, making it a bit choppy. Day after, conditions drop to 1 ft @7s, with surf being poor across most spots. Best: today.
