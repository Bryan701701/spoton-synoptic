Today in South Devon, it's a bit rough with 7 ft @10s SW swell and fresh 26 mph WSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve to 5 ft @8s SW with lighter 13 mph S winds, offering some workable options at spots like Bovisand Reef and Challborough during the tide windows. By the day after, it gets even better with 4 ft @9s SW and light 7 mph NW winds, making for clean conditions. Best: day after.
