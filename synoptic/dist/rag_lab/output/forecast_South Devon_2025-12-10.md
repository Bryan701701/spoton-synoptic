Today in South Devon, it's a bit rough with 7 ft @10s SW swell and fresh 26 mph WSW wind, making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve to 5 ft @8s SW with lighter 13 mph S winds, offering some workable surf at spots like Bovisand Reef and Bantham during the mid-day push. By the day after, the swell drops to 4 ft @9s SW, and with light 7 mph NW winds, it should be a fun day at the beaches. Best: day after.
