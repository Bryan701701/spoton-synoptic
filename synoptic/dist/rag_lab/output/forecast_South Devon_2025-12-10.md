Today in South Devon, it's a tough call with 7 ft @10s SW swell, but fresh 26 mph WSW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve to 5 ft @8s SW with lighter 13 mph S winds, making for a workable day at spots like Bovisand Reef and Bantham during the tide windows. Day after, it gets even better with 4 ft @9s SW and light 7 mph NW winds, perfect for a fun session. Best: day after.
