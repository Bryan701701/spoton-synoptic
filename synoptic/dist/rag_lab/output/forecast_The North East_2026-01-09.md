Today in the North East, it's a fun 3ft @ 6s ENE with fresh 13 mph NE winds. Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach are looking good, especially during their prime tides. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 5ft @ 8s with light 5 mph SE winds, making it a great day for a surf session at spots like Redcar and South Shields. Day after, conditions drop back to 3ft @ 6s but with strong 27 mph S winds, making it less favorable. Best: tomorrow.
