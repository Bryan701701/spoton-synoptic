Today in the North East, surf is rolling in at 3 ft @ 6s ENE with a fresh 13 mph NE wind. Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach are your best bets, especially during their prime tides. Tomorrow, conditions improve with swell building to 5 ft @ 8s ENE and light 5 mph SE winds, making for clean and fun waves across the region. The day after, expect a drop back to 3 ft @ 6s with strong 27 mph S winds, resulting in blown-out conditions. Best: tomorrow.
