Today in Gower, surf is on the smaller side at 3 ft @ 5s with fresh 9 mph NE winds creating some chop. Tomorrow, conditions drop further to 2 ft @ 6s with stronger 25 mph E winds making it blown out. Day after, Llangennith Beach and Oxwich Bay see a slight improvement with 1 ft @ 11s WSW, offering a clean window early. Best: day after.
