Today in Donegal, it's looking good with 6 ft @ 9s W swell and a moderate 11 mph SW wind. Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are prime spots, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions take a turn for the worse with 12 ft @ 13s W swell and fresh 22 mph SSW winds, making it poor across the board. By the day after, the swell drops to 8 ft @ 12s W with similar winds, but Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand should offer some fun options. Best: today.
