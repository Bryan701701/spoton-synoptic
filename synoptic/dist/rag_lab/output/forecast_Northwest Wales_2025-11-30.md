Today in Northwest Wales, Porth Oer is offering some fun with 3 ft @ 6s WNW and a fresh 14 mph NW wind. Best conditions are on the push from 14:45 to 16:35. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 6 ft @ 7s SW but with a stronger 23 mph SSW wind, making it blown out across the region. Day after, Porth Oer and Hells Mouth see a return to 3 ft @ 7s WSW with a lighter 14 mph S wind, creating workable surf. Best: today.
