Today on the Causeway Coast, conditions are poor with a fresh 34 mph SW wind creating blown-out surf at 5 ft @10s. Tomorrow, expect a nice improvement as the swell drops to 4 ft @9s with light 10 mph NNE winds, making for clean and fun waves at spots like White Park Bay and Portballintrae. The day after, surf drops further to 2 ft @7s, still workable at Portballintrae but overall less exciting. Best: tomorrow.
