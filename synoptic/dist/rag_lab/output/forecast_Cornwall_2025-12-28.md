Today, Cornwall is seeing poor conditions with 2 ft @ 8s N swell across the North, but fresh 15 mph ENE winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, the North coast improves slightly with 2 ft @ 10s WNW swell, but still not ideal. The South and West remain quiet, with the swell not hitting well. Day after, Bude shows some potential with 2 ft @ 10s NW, but conditions will still be challenging. Best: tomorrow.
