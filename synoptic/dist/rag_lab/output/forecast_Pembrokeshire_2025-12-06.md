Today in Pembrokeshire, it's looking poor with a hefty 13 ft @12s WSW swell and fresh 25 mph WSW wind, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 5 ft @11s WSW and a moderate 14 mph ESE wind, offering some workable surf at spots like Whitesands Bay and Freshwater West. The day after, the swell picks up to 8 ft @9s SW, still with 14 mph SW winds, keeping it fun but challenging. Best: tomorrow.
