Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a tough one with 13 ft @12s WSW swell and fresh 25 mph WSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 5 ft @11s WSW and moderate 14 mph ESE winds, offering some workable waves at spots like Whitesands Bay. The day after looks even better with 8 ft @9s SW swell and the same light 14 mph SW winds, making for fun surf. Best: day after.
