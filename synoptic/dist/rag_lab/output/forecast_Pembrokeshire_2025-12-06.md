Today in Pembrokeshire, conditions are poor with a hefty 13 ft @12s WSW swell and fresh 25 mph WSW winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees a drop to 5 ft @11s WSW, with lighter 14 mph ESE winds, offering some workable surf at spots like Whitesands Bay and Freshwater West. The day after, swell picks up to 8 ft @9s SW, still with 14 mph SW winds, keeping things fun but a bit choppy. Best: tomorrow.
