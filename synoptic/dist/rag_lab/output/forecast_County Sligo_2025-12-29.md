Today in County Sligo, Dunmoran Strand and Lackan Bay are both working with 2 ft @ 11s NNW and light 6 mph E winds, offering fun conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2 ft @ 8s with light ENE winds, making it less exciting. The day after also sees similar small surf at 2 ft @ 11s but with SSE winds, keeping it on the poor side. Best: today.
