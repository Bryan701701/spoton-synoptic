The East Coast is looking solid today with 4 ft @ 7s ESE swell and fresh 13 mph SSE winds. Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay are your best bets, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 7s ESE with lighter 9 mph S winds, making it a fun day at the beaches. By the day after, conditions ease further to 2 ft @ 6s ESE with light 4 mph WNW winds, still workable at St Andrews West and Arbroath. Best: today.
