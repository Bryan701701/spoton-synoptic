The East Coast is looking solid today with 4 ft @ 7s ESE swell and fresh 13 mph SSE winds. Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay are both working well, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 7s with light 9 mph S winds, still offering some fun at the same spots. By the day after, conditions ease further to 2 ft @ 6s with light 4 mph WNW winds, making it a quieter day. Best: today.
