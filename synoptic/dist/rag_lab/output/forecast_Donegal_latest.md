Today in Donegal, we're looking at solid conditions with 7 ft @ 11s W swell and a fresh 15 mph S wind. Magheroaty Beach and Bloody Foreland are your best bets, both offering clean waves throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 5 ft @ 12s W swell and light 7 mph SSE winds, making spots like Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand shine. The day after, expect similar 6 ft @ 12s W swell with light winds, keeping the fun going at Tullan Strand and Mullaghmore Strand. Best: tomorrow.
