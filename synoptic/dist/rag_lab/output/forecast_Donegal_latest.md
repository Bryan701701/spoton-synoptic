Today in Donegal, Streedagh Strand is the go-to spot with 3ft @6s NW swell and fresh 17 mph NNW winds. It’s clean early, but expect some chop as the day goes on. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 6ft @9s N swell and lighter 14 mph NNW winds across several spots, including Pollan Bay and Rosapenna. The day after, the swell drops to 5ft but fresh NNE winds may make it less appealing. Best: tomorrow.
