Today in Donegal, it's a solid 4 ft @ 11s WNW with a light 12 mph E wind, making for clean conditions at spots like Magheroaty Beach and Dooey Beach. Tomorrow sees a drop to 2 ft @ 11s with fresh 13 mph E winds, still workable at sheltered corners. By the day after, conditions remain similar with 2 ft @ 9s WNW and 15 mph ENE winds, so keep an eye on those spots. Best: today.
