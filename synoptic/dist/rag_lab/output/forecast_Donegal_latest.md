Today in Donegal, it's a great day with clean 3ft @11s W swell and light 5 mph ENE winds. Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are both firing, offering fun conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2ft @10s W with moderate 13 mph E winds, making it okay but not as exciting. By the day after, expect similar 2ft @10s W conditions, still workable at the best spots. Best: today.
