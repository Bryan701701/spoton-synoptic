Today in Donegal, it's a bit rough with fresh 20 mph SSW winds creating a blown-out situation. The swell is a hefty 12 ft @ 13s from the W, but it's not producing any workable surf. Tomorrow sees a similar story with 10 ft @ 12s W swell and fresh 25 mph winds, keeping conditions poor. By the day after, things improve slightly with 6 ft @ 10s W swell and lighter 17 mph WNW winds, making it more manageable at spots like Magheroaty Beach. Best: day after.
