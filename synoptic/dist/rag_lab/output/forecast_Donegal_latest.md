Today in Donegal, it's looking great with 3 ft @ 11s W at spots like Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty, both groomed by light ENE winds at 5 mph. The tides are favorable from early morning through the afternoon. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 10s W with fresh E winds at 13 mph, making it a bit choppy but still workable at sheltered corners. Day after, conditions remain similar with 2 ft @ 10s WNW and light ESE winds, offering a fun surf day. Best: today.
