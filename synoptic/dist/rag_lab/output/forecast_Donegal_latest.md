Today in Donegal, surf is looking fun with 3 ft @ 8s WNW at Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand, both holding shape under a fresh 17 mph NW wind. Mullaghmore Strand offers similar conditions. Tomorrow, we see a solid increase to 6 ft @ 9s WNW with light 9 mph winds, making it a great day for surf. The day after stays strong at 6 ft @ 10s WNW, with a bit more wind at 16 mph, but still plenty of options. Best: tomorrow.
