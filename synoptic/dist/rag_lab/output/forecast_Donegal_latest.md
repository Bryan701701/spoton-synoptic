Today in Donegal, conditions are poor with a hefty 17 ft @16s W swell, but fresh 16 mph SSE winds are making it messy. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 15 ft @14s, but winds pick up to a strong 26 mph WSW, keeping it blown out. By the day after, the swell continues to decrease to 7 ft @11s, with even stronger 35 mph SSE winds, resulting in challenging conditions. Best: today.
