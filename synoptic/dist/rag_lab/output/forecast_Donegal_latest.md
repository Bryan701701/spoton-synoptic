Today in Donegal, it's looking great with 4 ft @ 11s WNW swell and light E winds at 12 mph. Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are prime spots, both offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 11s W with fresh E winds, making for a less exciting surf day. By the day after, the conditions remain similar with 2 ft @ 9s WNW swell and a bit more wind. Best: today.
