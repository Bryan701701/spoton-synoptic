Today in Donegal, it's looking fun with 3 ft @10s W swell and light 9 mph E winds. Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are prime spots, both offering clean conditions from 08:58 to 16:05. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 5 ft @12s WNW with a moderate 10 mph E wind, keeping things lively across the coast. On the day after, expect 2-3 ft @11s WNW with fresh 15 mph ESE winds, making for a mixed bag. Best: tomorrow.
