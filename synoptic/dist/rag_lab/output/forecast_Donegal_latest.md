Today in Donegal, we have a solid 4 ft @ 11s W swell with a moderate 14 mph ESE wind. Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand are your best bets, both offering fun conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop as the swell remains but the wind picks up to 22 mph SSW, making it less inviting. The day after, expect a bigger swell at 8 ft @ 14s WSW, but strong 26 mph SE winds will make it blown out. Best: today.
