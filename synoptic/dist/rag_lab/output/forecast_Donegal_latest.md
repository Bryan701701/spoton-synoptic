Today in Donegal, we're seeing solid surf at 8 ft @ 11s W with fresh 17 mph SSW winds. Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are both working well, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 6 ft @ 12s W and lighter winds at 10 mph SSW, making for a fun day at spots like Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand. The day after, however, brings strong 29 mph S winds, resulting in blown-out conditions across the board. Best: tomorrow.
