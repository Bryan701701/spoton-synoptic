Today in Donegal, it's looking solid with 5 ft @9s NNW swell and fresh 14 mph NNW winds. Pollan Bay and Ballyheiran Bay are great spots to check out, offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 5 ft but drops to 8s, with winds picking up to 18 mph NE, still workable at the same spots. On the day after, expect a slight drop to 4 ft @7s with SSW winds, but Magheroaty Beach and others should still have fun waves. Best: today.
