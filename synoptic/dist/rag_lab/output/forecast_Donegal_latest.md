Today in Donegal, Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand are serving up clean 2 ft @ 6s WNW with a light 13 mph N wind. Perfect for a fun session! Tomorrow, expect a slight bump to 3 ft @ 6s NW with a fresh 17 mph N wind, still workable at the same spots. Day after, conditions improve further with 4 ft @ 8s NNW at Pollan Bay and others, but wind eases to 12 mph NNW. Best: day after.
