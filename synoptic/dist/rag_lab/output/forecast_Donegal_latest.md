Today in Donegal, conditions are poor with a hefty swell of 17 ft @ 16s from the W and fresh 16 mph SSE winds creating a blown-out scene. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 15 ft @ 14s, but winds pick up to a strong 26 mph WSW, keeping it messy. By the day after, the swell further decreases to 7 ft @ 11s with even stronger winds at 35 mph SSE, making for challenging conditions. Best: today.
