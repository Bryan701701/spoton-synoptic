Today in Donegal, surf is looking fun with 3 ft @ 8s WNW at spots like Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand, both working well despite fresh 17 mph NW winds. Tomorrow, conditions improve with a solid 6 ft @ 9s WNW and lighter 9 mph winds, making it a great day for a session at places like Magheroaty Beach. Day after, expect 4 ft @ 10s WNW with moderate 10 mph SW winds, still offering good options at Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand. Best: tomorrow.
