Today in Donegal, it's looking solid with 3 ft @ 12s WNW swell and light 4 mph ENE winds. Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are both clean and fun, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 2 ft @ 11s, still offering some workable conditions with moderate 11 mph ESE winds. By the day after, expect similar 2 ft @ 11s waves, but with a shift to SSW winds at 10 mph. Best: today.
