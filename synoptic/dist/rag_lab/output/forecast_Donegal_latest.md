Today in Donegal, Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are offering clean 2 ft @ 11s WNW with a moderate 13 mph E wind. It’s a great day for a surf session, especially from 08:59 to 16:11. Tomorrow, conditions improve with the same swell size but lighter winds at 6 mph SSW, making it a perfect day for fun waves at all the good spots. The day after, expect a shift with 3 ft @ 6s NW and fresh 16 mph NW winds, so it might be a bit choppy. Best: tomorrow.
