Today in Donegal, Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand are lighting up with 7 ft @ 13s W swell and a fresh 17 mph S wind. Expect clean conditions early, but it may get a bit messy later. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 5 ft @ 10s W with stronger 26 mph SSW winds, making it less inviting. Day after, similar conditions persist with 5 ft @ 11s W swell and 21 mph SSW winds, keeping it on the poor side. Best: today.
