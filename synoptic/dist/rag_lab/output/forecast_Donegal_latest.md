Today in Donegal, surf is looking fun with 2 ft @ 11s WNW at spots like Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty, with a moderate 13 mph E wind. It's clean and workable, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow brings similar conditions, with the same swell and lighter 6 mph SSW winds, making it a great day for a session. The day after, expect a bump to 3 ft @ 6s NW, but with fresh 16 mph NW winds, it might be a bit choppy. Best: tomorrow.
