Today in Donegal, it's looking solid with 8 ft @11s W swell and fresh 17 mph SSW winds. Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are both working well, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow brings a bit of a shift, with swell dropping to 6 ft @12s W and lighter winds at 10 mph SSW, making for good conditions at spots like Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand. Day after, however, winds ramp up to 29 mph S, creating blown-out conditions across the board. Best: tomorrow.
