Today in Donegal, it's looking solid with 5 ft @10s WNW swell and light 4 mph NNW winds. Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are prime spots to catch some fun waves, especially during the best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 6 ft @12s with light winds, making for a great session at Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand. Day after, conditions drop with 3 ft @6s and fresh SSE winds, likely making it a bit messy. Best: tomorrow.
