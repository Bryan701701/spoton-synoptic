Today in Donegal, it's looking solid with 7 ft @ 14s W swell and 12 mph SE winds. Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand are prime spots, offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 7 ft @ 13s WSW with lighter 11 mph SSW winds, keeping it fun at places like Magheroaty Beach and Bloody Foreland. By the day after, the swell drops to 6 ft @ 11s W, still workable but with fresh 13 mph SSE winds. Best: today.
