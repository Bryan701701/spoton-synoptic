Today in Donegal, it's looking great with 7 ft @ 14s W swell and light SE winds at 12 mph. Best spots include Rossnowlagh, Tullan Strand, and The Peak, all working well throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions remain solid with 7 ft @ 13s WSW swell and light SSW winds, making for a fun day at Magheroaty Beach and Bloody Foreland. Day after, the swell drops to 6 ft @ 11s W with fresh SSE winds, but still some workable waves at Magheroaty and Bloody Foreland. Best: today.
