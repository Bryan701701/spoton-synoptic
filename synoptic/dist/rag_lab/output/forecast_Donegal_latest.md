Today in Donegal, it’s looking good with 3 ft @ 11s WNW swell and a moderate 13 mph E wind. Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are your best bets, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions improve with the same swell height but a lighter 6 mph NE wind, making for clean surf all day. The day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 11s, still fun but less powerful. Best: tomorrow.
