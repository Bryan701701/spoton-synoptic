Today in Donegal, it's a bit of a bummer with a fresh 21 mph SW wind blowing across 7 ft @ 8s W swell, making it blown out and messy. Tomorrow looks much better as the swell holds at 7 ft @ 10s NW with light 10 mph NW winds, offering clean conditions at spots like Pollan Bay and Ballyheiran Bay. The day after, we see a slight drop to 6 ft @ 9s NW, with moderate SSW winds, still providing some workable waves at sheltered beaches. Best: tomorrow.
