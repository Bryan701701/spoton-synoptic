Today in Donegal, it’s a solid 6 ft @9s NW with fresh 17 mph SSE winds. Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are great picks, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, expect a bump to 9 ft @14s W with lighter 15 mph SW winds, making for some fun conditions. By the day after, surf drops to 5 ft @14s W, but with a light 11 mph ESE wind, it should be clean and enjoyable at spots like Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand. Best: tomorrow.
