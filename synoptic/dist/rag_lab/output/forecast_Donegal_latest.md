Today in Donegal, conditions are poor with a hefty 12 ft @ 13s W swell, but fresh 20 mph SSW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 10 ft @ 12s W, but winds pick up to 25 mph W, keeping it messy. By the day after, things improve a bit with 6 ft @ 10s W swell and lighter winds at 17 mph WNW, offering some workable options at spots like Magheroaty Beach. Best: day after.
