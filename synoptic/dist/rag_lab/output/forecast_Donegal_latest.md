Today in Donegal, we have solid surf at 6 ft @ 12s W with light ENE winds at 8 mph. Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are both looking great, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 11s W with light E winds, making it a fun day for smaller waves. On the day after, we see a return to 6 ft @ 12s WNW, with NE winds keeping it clean. Best: today.
