Today in Donegal, conditions are poor with a swell of 6 ft @ 8s from the WSW and fresh 24 mph SSE winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight increase in swell to 7 ft @ 8s, but the wind remains fresh at 21 mph from the S, keeping it messy. Day after, things improve significantly with a solid 8 ft @ 11s NW swell and light 5 mph ESE winds, offering clean and fun surf at spots like Pollan Bay and Ballyheiran Bay. Best: day after.
