Today in Donegal, it's looking solid with 6 ft @ 13s W swell and fresh 13 mph SSW winds. Magheroaty Beach and Bloody Foreland are both working well, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, expect similar conditions with 6 ft @ 11s W swell and a bit more wind at 17 mph SSE, still offering good surf at the same spots. Day after, the swell holds at 6 ft @ 10s WSW with 16 mph SW winds, keeping the fun going. Best: today.
