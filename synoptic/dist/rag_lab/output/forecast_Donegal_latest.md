Today in Donegal, it's looking solid with 5 ft @ 9s NNW swell and 14 mph NNW winds. Pollan Bay and Ballyheiran Bay are great spots to catch some fun waves, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 5 ft but the period shortens to 8s with fresh 18 mph NE winds, still workable at the same spots. On the day after, conditions ease a bit with 4 ft @ 7s NW swell and 15 mph SSW winds, offering a nice chance at Magheroaty Beach and others. Best: today.
