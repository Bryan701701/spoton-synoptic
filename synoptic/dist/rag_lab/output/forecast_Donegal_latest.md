Today in Donegal, it's looking great with 3 ft @12s WNW swell and light 4 mph ENE winds. Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are prime spots, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @11s WNW with a moderate 11 mph ESE breeze, still offering some fun at the same locations. By the day after, conditions remain similar with 2 ft @11s NW swell and 10 mph SSW winds, keeping the surf lively. Best: today.
