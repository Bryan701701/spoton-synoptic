Today in Donegal, we have a solid 6 ft @ 13s W swell with fresh 13 mph SSW winds. Magheroaty Beach and Bloody Foreland are both looking good, with optimal tides from 08:42 to 16:05. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 6 ft but the period shortens to 11s, with winds picking up to 17 mph SSE, still offering some fun options. On the day after, expect the swell to remain at 6 ft, but with a slightly shorter 10s period and SW winds at 16 mph. Best: today.
