Today in Donegal, it's looking great with 7 ft @ 12s W swell and light 11 mph S winds. Top spots like Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand are clean and working well, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 5 ft @ 10s W with fresh 16 mph WSW winds, making it a bit choppy but still surfable at places like Magheroaty Beach. By the day after, the swell increases to 10 ft @ 13s W, but the fresh SSE winds will make it blown out. Best: today.
