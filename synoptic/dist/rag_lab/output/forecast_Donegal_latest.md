Today in Donegal, we’ve got fun conditions with 4ft @9s WNW swell and light 9 mph WNW winds. Good spots like Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand are clean and working well. Tomorrow, expect a bump to 5ft @10s WNW with similar winds, keeping it tidy at places like Magheroaty Beach and Bloody Foreland. Day after, we’ll see a solid 8ft @11s W swell with light ESE winds, perfect for the more adventurous surfers at spots like Mageroaty and Dooey Beach. Best: day after.
