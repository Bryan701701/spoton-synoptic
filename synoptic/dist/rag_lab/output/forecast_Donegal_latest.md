Today in Donegal, conditions are poor with a hefty 13 ft @ 15s W swell, but fresh 20 mph SSE winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 12 ft @ 14s W, but winds pick up to 25 mph S, keeping it messy. By the day after, the swell continues to decrease to 9 ft @ 11s W with 18 mph S winds, still not ideal. Best: day after.
