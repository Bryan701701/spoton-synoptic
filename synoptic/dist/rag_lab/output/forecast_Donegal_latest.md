Today in Donegal, it's looking good with 3 ft @6s NW swell and light NNW winds at 9 mph. Rossnowlagh, Tullan Strand, and Mullaghmore Strand are all clean and fun, especially on the push. Tomorrow, swell drops to 2 ft @6s with light NW winds, still workable at the same spots. The day after, conditions get tricky with 8 ft @9s N swell and fresh 29 mph N winds, making it blown out. Best: today.
