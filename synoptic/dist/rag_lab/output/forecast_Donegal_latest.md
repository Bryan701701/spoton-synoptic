Today in Donegal, it's looking great with a solid 5ft @ 12s WNW swell and light E winds at 11 mph. Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are prime spots, both offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2–3ft @ 11s, still workable at Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand, but expect a bit more chop with fresh E winds. By the day after, conditions improve again with 3ft @ 11s W swell and lighter NE winds, making it a fun day at sheltered spots like Magheroaty Beach. Best: today.
