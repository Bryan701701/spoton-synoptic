Today in Donegal, it's a bit of a washout with fresh 20 mph SW winds on 4 ft @ 6s WNW swell, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow brings a nice improvement with 3 ft @ 8s WNW swell and light 8 mph NW winds, making spots like Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand work well. The day after, expect 6 ft @ 9s WNW swell with similar light winds, offering solid conditions at various beaches. Best: tomorrow.
