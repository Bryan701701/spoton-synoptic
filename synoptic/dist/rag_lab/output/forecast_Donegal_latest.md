Today in Donegal, it's looking solid with 11 ft @ 16s W swell and light SE winds at 9 mph. Mageroaty and Bloody Foreland are your top picks, offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 6 ft @ 12s W, still fun at spots like Magheroaty Beach and Bloody Foreland, with light E winds. By the day after, the surf continues to ease to 4 ft @ 12s W, but still workable at sheltered spots like Dooey Beach and Maghera Beach. Best: today.
