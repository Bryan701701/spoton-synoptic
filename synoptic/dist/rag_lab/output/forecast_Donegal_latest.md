Today in Donegal, conditions are poor with 7 ft @ 8s W swell and fresh 21 mph SW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow looks much better as the swell builds to 7 ft @ 10s NW with light 10 mph NW winds, offering clean surf at spots like Pollan Bay and Ballyheiran Bay. The day after, the swell drops slightly to 6 ft @ 9s NW with moderate 16 mph SSW winds, still producing some fun waves at sheltered spots. Best: tomorrow.
