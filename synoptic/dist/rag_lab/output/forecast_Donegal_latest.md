Today in Donegal, it's a bit rough with 14 ft @ 13s W swell and fresh 35 mph WSW winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees a drop to 7 ft @ 11s W with 29 mph SE winds, still not ideal. However, by the day after, conditions improve significantly with 11 ft @ 15s W swell and light 8 mph E winds, offering some great options at spots like Mageroaty and Bloody Foreland. Best: day after.
