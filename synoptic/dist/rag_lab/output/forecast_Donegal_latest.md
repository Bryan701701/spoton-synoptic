Today in Donegal, we're looking at some solid surf with 5 ft @ 9s WNW swell and moderate 11 mph WNW winds. Great options include Magheroaty Beach and Bloody Foreland, both offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 4 ft @ 8s with light onshore winds, making it a bit choppy but still fun at spots like Rossnowlagh. By the day after, we're seeing an increase to 8 ft @ 13s, but fresh SW winds may make it challenging. Best: today.
