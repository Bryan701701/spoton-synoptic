Today in Donegal, surf is looking solid with 7 ft @14s W swell and light SE winds at 12 mph. Good spots like Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand are firing, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions remain fun with 7 ft @13s WSW swell and light SSW winds, keeping spots like Magheroaty Beach and Bloody Foreland in play. Day after, the swell drops to 6 ft @11s W with fresh SSE winds, making it a bit choppy but still workable at sheltered corners. Best: today.
