Today in Donegal, it's looking good with 4 ft @ 11s W swell and a moderate 14 mph ESE wind. Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand are both working well, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @ 9s WSW with fresh 18 mph SSW winds, making it a less favorable day. The day after, we see a significant swell increase to 8 ft @ 14s WSW, but strong 26 mph SE winds will make it blown out. Best: today.
