Today in Donegal, surf is looking solid with 7 ft @ 13s W and fresh 17 mph S winds. Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand are your best bets, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 5 ft @ 10s W and fresh 26 mph SSW winds, making it less favorable. The day after continues the trend with similar conditions, so it’s best to enjoy today’s waves! Best: today.
