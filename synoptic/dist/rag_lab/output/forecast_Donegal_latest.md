Today in Donegal, it's looking good with 3 ft @ 8s WNW swell and light 2 mph S winds. Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand are both clean and fun, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions shift with the swell dropping to 3 ft @ 8s W, but winds pick up to 16 mph S, making it a bit choppy. On the day after, expect 8 ft @ 12s W swell, but with fresh 17 mph SSW winds, so it may be a bit messy. Best: today.
