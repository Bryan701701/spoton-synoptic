Today in Donegal, it's a clean day with 2 ft @11s NW swell and light 5 mph E winds. Good spots like Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are working well, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 3 ft @6s NW with fresh 15 mph NNW winds, making for a fun day at places like Rossnowlagh and Mullaghmore Strand. The day after, expect similar conditions but with stronger winds at 25 mph, so look for sheltered corners. Best: tomorrow.
