Today in Donegal, it's looking good with clean 3 ft @ 6s NW swell and light NNW winds at 9 mph. Rossnowlagh, Tullan Strand, and Mullaghmore Strand are all fun options throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 6s WNW, but with light NW winds, it should still be workable at the same spots. Day after, expect larger 8 ft @ 9s N swell, but fresh N winds will make it blown out. Best: today.
