Today in Donegal, conditions are rough with a hefty 11 ft @10s W swell and fresh 30 mph WSW winds creating a blown-out scene. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 8 ft @10s WSW but the wind picks up to a strong 41 mph S, keeping it messy. On the day after, expect a more powerful 12 ft @14s W swell with moderate 19 mph SSE winds, still not ideal for clean waves. Best: day after.
