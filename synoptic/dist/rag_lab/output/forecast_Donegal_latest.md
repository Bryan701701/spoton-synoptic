Today in Donegal, it's a fun day with 3 ft @6s NW swell and light 9 mph NNW winds. Good spots like Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand are clean and working well. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2 ft @6s WNW with light 6 mph NW winds, still offering some playful waves at the same spots. Day after, expect a significant swell increase to 8 ft @9s N, but fresh 29 mph winds will make it blown out. Best: today.
