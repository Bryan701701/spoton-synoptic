Today in Donegal, it's a fun 3ft @10s W with light E winds at 9 mph, making for clean conditions at spots like Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty. Tomorrow, expect a solid increase to 5ft @12s WNW with the same light E winds, keeping it clean and exciting at multiple locations. On the day after, conditions drop back to 2-3ft @11s WNW with fresh ESE winds, but still workable at sheltered spots like Rossnowlagh. Best: tomorrow.
