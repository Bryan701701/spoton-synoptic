Today in Donegal, it’s a challenging surf day with 14 ft @ 13s W swell but fresh 35 mph WSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a drop to 7 ft @ 11s W, still with fresh 29 mph SE winds, keeping conditions poor. Day after, we finally get some clean surf with 11 ft @ 15s W and light 8 mph E winds, offering great options at spots like Mageroaty and Bloody Foreland. Best: day after.
