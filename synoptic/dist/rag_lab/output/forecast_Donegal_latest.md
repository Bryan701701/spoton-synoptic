Today in Donegal, it's looking solid with 5 ft @9s WNW swell and a moderate 11 mph WNW wind. Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are prime spots, both offering fun waves throughout the day. Tomorrow, we see a slight drop to 4 ft @8s with S winds at 10 mph, still keeping things lively at Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand. By the day after, swell picks up to 8 ft @13s, but fresh S winds at 15 mph may make it a bit challenging. Best: today.
