Today in Donegal, surf is looking fun with 2 ft @ 11s WNW at spots like Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty, all under a moderate 13 mph E wind. Tomorrow brings cleaner conditions with the same swell size but lighter 6 mph SSW winds, making it a great day for a session at any of the local beaches. On the day after, expect a bump in size to 3 ft @ 6s NW, but winds will be fresh at 16 mph NW, making it a bit tricky. Best: tomorrow.
