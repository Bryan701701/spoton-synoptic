Today in Donegal, it's looking fun with clean 3 ft @ 8s WNW swell and light 2 mph S winds. Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand are your best bets, offering good windows throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions shift a bit with the same swell size but fresh 16 mph S winds, making it a bit choppy. On the day after, expect larger 8 ft @ 12s W swell, but with fresh winds, it may be tricky. Best: today.
