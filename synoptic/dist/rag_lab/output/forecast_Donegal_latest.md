Today in Donegal, it's looking solid with 7 ft @ 14s W swell and a light 12 mph SE wind. Great options at Rossnowlagh, Tullan Strand, and The Peak, all offering clean conditions. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 7 ft @ 13s WSW, with a gentle 11 mph SSW breeze, making spots like Magheroaty Beach and Bloody Foreland worth a visit. On the day after, expect a drop to 6 ft @ 11s W with a fresh 13 mph SSE wind, still workable at sheltered spots. Best: today.
