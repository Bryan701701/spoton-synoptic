Today on the East Coast, conditions are poor with a swell of 3 ft @ 5s SSE and fresh 19 mph SSE winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a bit of an increase to 5 ft @ 7s SE, but the wind picks up to 22 mph SSE, keeping it messy. The day after, the swell rises to 7 ft @ 8s SE with strong 30 mph SE winds, likely making it challenging. Best: tomorrow.
