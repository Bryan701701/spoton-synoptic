Today in the North East, surf is rolling in at 2 ft @ 5s ESE with fresh 17 mph SE winds. Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands are your best bets, with workable conditions from 08:24 to 15:39. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with swell rising to 3 ft @ 6s E, and winds easing to 15 mph ESE, making it a fun day at spots like Saltburn and Hartlepool. Day after, expect similar 3 ft @ 6s E swell, but with winds at 14 mph SE, keeping the surf lively. Best: tomorrow.
