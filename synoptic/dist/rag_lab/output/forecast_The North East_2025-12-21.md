Today, the North East is seeing fun 2 ft @ 5s ESE lines with a fresh 17 mph SE wind. Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands are your best bets, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 3 ft @ 6s E swell and a lighter 15 mph ESE wind, making it a great day for a surf session. The day after holds similar 3 ft @ 6s E waves, with a slight drop in wind to 14 mph SE. Best: tomorrow.
