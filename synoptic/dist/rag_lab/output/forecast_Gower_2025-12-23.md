Today on Gower, it's a bit of a bummer with 3 ft @7s S swell but fresh 10 mph E wind making it blown out. Tomorrow, similar conditions persist with 3 ft @6s E swell and light 7 mph NNE wind, still not producing much. Day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @5s ENE with fresh 14 mph NE wind, keeping it messy. Best: tomorrow.
