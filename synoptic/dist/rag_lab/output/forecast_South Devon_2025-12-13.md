Today in South Devon, Bantham is lighting up with a fun 3ft @10s SW swell and light 6 mph WSW winds. Perfect for a session, especially during the tide window from 08:07 to 16:11. Tomorrow, conditions drop with a 4ft @6s SW swell and fresh 21 mph SW winds, making it less appealing. The day after, we see a slight improvement with 5ft @7s SSW swell and moderate 17 mph S winds at Bantham and nearby spots. Best: today.
