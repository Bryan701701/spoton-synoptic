Today in the Hebrides, it's a tough call with 8 ft @ 13s W swell, but fresh 20 mph S winds have it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 7 ft @ 12s WSW swell and 17 mph ESE winds, making for some workable conditions at spots like Europie and Dalbeg. By the day after, conditions get even better with 4 ft @ 10s WNW swell and light 9 mph ESE winds, perfect for a fun session at places like Barvas and Mangersta. Best: day after.
