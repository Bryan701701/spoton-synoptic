Today in the Hebrides, it's a bit of a bummer with fresh 20 mph S winds creating a blown-out scene across all spots, including the likes of Tolsta and Port of Ness, which are showing 8 ft @ 13s W. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 7 ft @ 12s WSW swell and 17 mph ESE winds, making for some workable corners at places like Europie and Barvas. By the day after, the surf drops to 4 ft @ 10s WNW with light 9 mph ESE winds, offering a much cleaner experience at spots like Dalbeg and Scarasta. Best: day after.
