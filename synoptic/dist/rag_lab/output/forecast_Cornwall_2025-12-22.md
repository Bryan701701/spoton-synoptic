Today, North and West coasts are looking good with 5 ft @ 12s W swell and light ESE winds. Crantock and Fistral are prime spots, especially on the early push. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 10s W, but still some fun at Crantock and Fistral. Day after, North has 3 ft @ 9s NW, with Kennack Sands showing some promise in the South. Best: today.
