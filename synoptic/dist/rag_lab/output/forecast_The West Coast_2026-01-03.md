Today on the West Coast, it's looking solid with 6 ft @ 7s NNW and fresh 18 mph NNW winds. Balephetrish and Balevullin Bay are your go-to spots, both working well throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @ 6s, but still offers fun waves at the same spots. By the day after, conditions remain similar with 4 ft @ 6s, but winds ease a bit to 14 mph, making for a more enjoyable session. Best: today.
