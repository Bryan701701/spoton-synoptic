Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it's looking great with 6 ft @9s NW swell and light 4 mph ENE winds. Ballybunion Right and Ballybunion Beach are prime spots, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 7 ft @9s W swell and fresh 28 mph W winds, making it blown out and not workable. The day after continues the trend with 9 ft @10s WNW swell and 24 mph W winds, keeping it poor across the board. Best: today.
