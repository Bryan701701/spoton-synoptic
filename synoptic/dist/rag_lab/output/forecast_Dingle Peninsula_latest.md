Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it's a quiet scene with no surf action—wrong swell angle and fresh NNW winds at 22 mph. Tomorrow, conditions remain poor with 6 ft @9s W swell but fresh SSW winds at 28 mph will keep it blown out. On the day after, we see a slight improvement with 10 ft @12s W swell, but wind remains fresh at 16 mph SW, making it workable only at select spots like Mossies and Coumeenole during the tide windows. Best: day after.
