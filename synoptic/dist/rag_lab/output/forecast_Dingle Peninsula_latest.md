Today on the Dingle Peninsula, conditions are poor with a swell of 4 ft @ 6s WNW and fresh 28 mph SW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 5 ft @ 8s NW with much lighter 12 mph NW winds, offering some good options at spots like Ballybunion Beach. The day after continues with similar swell at 5 ft @ 9s WNW, but winds ease to 6 mph N, making it a great day for a surf session. Best: tomorrow.
