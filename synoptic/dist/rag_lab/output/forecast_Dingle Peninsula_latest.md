Today on the Dingle Peninsula, conditions are poor with a hefty 15 ft @13s W swell and fresh 31 mph W winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 10 ft @10s SW, but the wind ramps up to a strong 43 mph SSE, keeping it messy. By the day after, we see some improvement with 11 ft @14s W swell and lighter 12 mph SE winds, offering a better chance at workable waves at spots like Ballybunion Left and Garywilliam Point. Best: day after.
