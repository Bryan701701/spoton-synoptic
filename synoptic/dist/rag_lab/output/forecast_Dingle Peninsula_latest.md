Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it's a bit of a struggle with fresh N winds at 22 mph and 5 ft @9s NNW swell, making conditions blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 5 ft @8s NNW swell and lighter NNE winds at 15 mph, offering some workable options at spots like Ballybunion Beach. The day after brings cleaner conditions with 4 ft @10s NNW swell and light ENE winds, perfect for a fun session at Ballybunion. Best: day after.
