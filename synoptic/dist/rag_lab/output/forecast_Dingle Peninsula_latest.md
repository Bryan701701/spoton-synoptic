Today, Dingle Peninsula is lighting up with 6 ft @9s NW swell and light 4 mph ENE winds. Great options at Ballybunion Right and Ballybunion Beach, especially during the early and mid-day tides. Tomorrow, conditions drop with fresh 28 mph W winds and 7 ft @9s W swell, making it poor across the board. The day after continues the trend with 9 ft @10s WNW swell and 24 mph W winds, keeping it blown out. Best: today.
