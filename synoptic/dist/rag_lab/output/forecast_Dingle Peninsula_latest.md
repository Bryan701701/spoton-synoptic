Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it's looking good with 7 ft @9s W swell and fresh 18 mph WNW winds. Ballybunion Right and Ballybunion Beach are your best bets, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 10 ft @10s WNW with fresh 20 mph NW winds, making it poor across the board. The day after, we see 6 ft @8s SW swell with similar winds, still not ideal. Best: today.
