Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it's looking solid with 6 ft @12s WNW swell and light 8 mph ENE winds. Ballybunion Right and Ballybunion Beach are your top picks, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @10s with fresh 21 mph E winds, making it poor across the board. Day after, it further declines to 2 ft @9s with 19 mph ENE winds, still not ideal. Best: today.
