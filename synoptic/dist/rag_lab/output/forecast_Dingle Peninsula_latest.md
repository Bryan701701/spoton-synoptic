Today on the Dingle Peninsula, conditions are poor with 11 ft @10s WSW swell and fresh 32 mph WSW winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow, expect similar poor conditions with 13 ft @10s SW swell and strong 43 mph S winds, keeping it messy. The day after, still poor with 13 ft @13s W swell and 25 mph SSW winds, so it remains challenging. Best: none.
