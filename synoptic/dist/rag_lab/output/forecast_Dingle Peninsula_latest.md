Today on the Dingle Peninsula, conditions are poor with 0 ft @ 0 s and calm winds. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 16 ft @ 14 s WSW, but fresh 35 mph WSW winds will make it blown out. By the day after, things improve slightly with 7 ft @ 10 s WSW and lighter winds at 18 mph, offering some workable options at spots like Ballybunion. Best: day after.
