Today on the Dingle Peninsula, we've got 6 ft @ 8s NW swell with a fresh 12 mph WNW wind. It's looking good at spots like Ballybunion Right and Ballybunion Beach, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 5 ft @ 9s WNW swell and light 6 mph SSW winds, making it a fun day for all. However, day after brings 8 ft @ 9s W swell with strong 27 mph WNW winds, likely making it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
