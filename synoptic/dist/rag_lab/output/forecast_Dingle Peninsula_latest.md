Today on the Dingle Peninsula, conditions are poor with a hefty swell of 11 ft @10s from the WSW, but fresh 32 mph winds are blowing it out. Tomorrow sees a slight increase in swell to 13 ft @10s from the SW, with even stronger winds at 43 mph, making it a challenging day. The day after, the swell remains at 13 ft but with a longer period of 13s and winds easing to 25 mph, offering a bit more potential for workable waves. Best: day after.
