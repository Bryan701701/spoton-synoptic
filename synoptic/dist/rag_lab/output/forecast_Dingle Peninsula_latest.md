Today on the Dingle Peninsula, surf is looking solid at 8 ft @12s W with a moderate 14 mph W wind. Ballybunion Left and Garywilliam Point are your best bets, especially during the early tide window. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 10 ft @10s WSW with fresh 30 mph SW winds, making it blown out and not producing. The day after brings even bigger 16 ft @15s W swell but with strong 33 mph S winds, keeping it poor across the board. Best: today.
