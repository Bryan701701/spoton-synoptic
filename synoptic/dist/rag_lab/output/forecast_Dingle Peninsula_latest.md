Today is quiet on the Dingle Peninsula with no surf, as the swell isn't hitting this coast. Tomorrow brings a solid 8 ft @ 11s WSW with light 11 mph W winds, making it a great day for spots like Ballybunion Left and Mossies. The day after, conditions will be OK with 9 ft @ 12s W swell, but winds pick up to 15 mph W, so look for sheltered corners. Best: tomorrow.
