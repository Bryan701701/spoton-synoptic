Today on the Dingle Peninsula, surf is looking solid at 7 ft @10s WSW with a fresh 15 mph W wind. Best spots include Ballybunion Right and Ballybunion Beach, both offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop to a hefty 11 ft @11s WSW, but the fresh 26 mph SSW wind will make it blown out and poor. Day after, the swell increases to 14 ft @11s SSW with even stronger 35 mph S winds, keeping it messy. Best: today.
