Today on the Dingle Peninsula, conditions are poor with a hefty 13 ft @14s W swell but fresh 23 mph SW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 11 ft @12s W, but the winds pick up to a strong 35 mph SSW, keeping it messy. Day after, the swell holds at 12 ft @10s SW with even stronger winds at 37 mph SSW, still not ideal. Best: none.
