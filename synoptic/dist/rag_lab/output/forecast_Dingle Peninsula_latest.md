Today, Dingle Peninsula is lighting up with 4 ft @10s WNW swell and a light 10 mph NE wind. Ballybunion Right and Ballybunion Beach are the top picks, with good conditions from early through the afternoon. Tomorrow, expect 6 ft @12s WNW swell but fresh 23 mph ENE winds will make it blown out across the region. On the day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @10s WNW with a lighter 11 mph ENE wind, making for more manageable surf at spots like Ballybunion. Best: today.
