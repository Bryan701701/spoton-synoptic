Today on the Dingle Peninsula, conditions are poor with 11 ft @12s W swell and fresh 32 mph SSW winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow, similar swell continues at 11 ft but with even stronger 34 mph SSW winds, keeping it messy. By the day after, the swell drops to 9 ft @11s W, and while winds ease to 14 mph W, only a few spots like Ballybunion Left and Garywilliam Point show some potential. Best: day after.
