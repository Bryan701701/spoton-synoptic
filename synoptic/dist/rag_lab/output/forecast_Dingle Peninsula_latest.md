Today on the Dingle Peninsula, you can find some fun waves at Ballybunion Right and Ballybunion Beach, both offering 2 ft @ 10s WNW with a fresh 15 mph ENE wind. Best times are around the tides from 08:49 to 16:31. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 3 ft @ 12s WNW and lighter 10 mph E winds, making it a great day for a surf. The day after, expect 2 ft @ 11s WNW but with fresh 22 mph E winds, which will likely chop things up. Best: tomorrow.
