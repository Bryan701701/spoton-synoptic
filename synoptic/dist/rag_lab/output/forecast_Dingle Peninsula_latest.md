Today on the Dingle Peninsula, conditions are poor with a hefty 15 ft @ 13s W swell and fresh 31 mph W winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 10 ft @ 10s SW, but winds pick up to a strong 43 mph SSE, keeping it messy. On the day after, we see a shift with 11 ft @ 14s W swell and lighter 12 mph SE winds, offering some good options at spots like Ballybunion Left and Garywilliam Point during the tide windows. Best: day after.
