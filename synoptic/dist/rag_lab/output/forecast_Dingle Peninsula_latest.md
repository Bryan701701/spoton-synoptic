Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it's flat with no surf—wrong swell angle and light winds. Tomorrow sees a nice bump to 7 ft @10s WSW with moderate 14 mph SW winds, making for some workable conditions at spots like Ballybunion Beach. The day after, conditions drop again to 10 ft @11s WSW, but fresh winds will likely chop things up. Best: tomorrow.
