Today on the Dingle Peninsula, conditions are poor with 4 ft @ 6s WNW swell and fresh 28 mph SW winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow, we see an improvement with 5 ft @ 8s NW swell and lighter 12 mph NW winds, making for clean surf at spots like Ballybunion. The day after continues the trend with similar 5 ft @ 9s WNW swell and light 6 mph N winds, offering great conditions again. Best: tomorrow.
