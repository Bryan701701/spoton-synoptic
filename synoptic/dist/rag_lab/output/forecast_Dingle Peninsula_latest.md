Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it’s a no-go with 10 ft @12s WSW swell and fresh 29 mph SSW winds creating a blown-out scene. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with 11 ft @11s SW swell and even stronger 36 mph S winds, keeping it poor across the board. The day after, similar swell at 11 ft @10s WSW with 30 mph W winds means it’s still not producing. Best: none.
