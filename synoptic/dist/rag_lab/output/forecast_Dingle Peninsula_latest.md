Today on the Dingle Peninsula, expect some fun with 2 ft @ 11s WNW swell and fresh 14 mph E winds. Ballybunion Right and Ballybunion Beach are your best bets, especially on the mid-tide push. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 2 ft @ 10s WNW and a slight increase in wind to 17 mph SE, still workable at the same spots. By the day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 9s WNW, but winds ease to 9 mph NW, making it a clean day at Ballybunion. Best: day after.
