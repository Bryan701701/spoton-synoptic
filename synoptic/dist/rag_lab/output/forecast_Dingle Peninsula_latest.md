Dingle Peninsula is lighting up today with solid surf at 12 ft @14s W and light E winds. Ballybunion Left and Garywilliam Point are the top picks, best during the mid-morning window. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 7 ft @11s WNW with fresh NNE winds, making for a workable session at various spots. The day after continues with 5 ft @11s W, still offering some fun waves but with a bit more wind. Best: today.
