Today, the Dingle Peninsula is experiencing poor conditions with 5 ft @7s N swell and fresh 20 mph NNE winds. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 4 ft @7s NW, but the fresh 23 mph WSW winds will keep it blown out. The day after, conditions remain similar with 5 ft @8s NW swell and 19 mph NNW winds, still not ideal. Best: none.
