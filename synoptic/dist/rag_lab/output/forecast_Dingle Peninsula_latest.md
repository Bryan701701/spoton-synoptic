Today on the Dingle Peninsula, conditions are poor with a hefty 15 ft @15s W swell, but fresh 29 mph S winds are blowing it out. Tomorrow, the swell increases to 17 ft @14s W with similar wind conditions, keeping things messy. By the day after, the swell drops to 11 ft @10s WSW, but the fresh 26 mph SSW wind will still keep it choppy. Best: day after.
