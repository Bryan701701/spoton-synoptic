Today on the Dingle Peninsula, conditions are poor with 0 ft @ 0 s and no surf energy. Tomorrow remains similar, with 8 ft @ 9 s from the NW but fresh 27 mph N winds making it blown out. The day after sees a slight drop to 7 ft @ 9 s, still with fresh 26 mph SSW winds keeping it messy. Best: day after.
