Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it's looking great with 6 ft @9s NW swell and light 4 mph ENE winds. Ballybunion Right and Beach are prime spots, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 7 ft @9s W swell but fresh 28 mph W winds will make it blown out. The day after, expect 9 ft @10s WNW swell with similar strong winds, keeping it messy. Best: today.
