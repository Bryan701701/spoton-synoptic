Today on the Dingle Peninsula, conditions are poor with 13 ft @14s W swell and fresh 23 mph SW winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 11 ft @12s W, but the wind picks up to a strong 35 mph SSW, keeping it messy. Day after, expect 12 ft @10s SW with even stronger winds at 37 mph SSW, making it another tough day for surf. Best: today.
