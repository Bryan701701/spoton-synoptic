Today on the Dingle Peninsula, we've got solid surf at 11 ft @ 12s W with a fresh 14 mph W wind. Ballybunion Left and Garywilliam Point are clean early, with the best window from 09:30–09:39. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 10 ft @ 10s W but with a stronger 23 mph W wind, making it poor across the board. Day after, still poor with 11 ft @ 11s WSW and a hefty 47 mph SSE wind. Best: today.
