Today in Dingle Peninsula, conditions are poor with a hefty 11 ft @ 11s W swell and fresh 38 mph SSE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell increases to 16 ft @ 14s WSW, but with similar fresh winds at 35 mph, it remains unworkable. By the day after, the swell drops to 7 ft @ 10s WSW with lighter 18 mph W winds, creating some workable options at spots like Ballybunion. Best: day after.
