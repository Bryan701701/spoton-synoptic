Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it's looking fun with 2 ft @ 11s W and fresh 14 mph ENE winds. Ballybunion Right and Ballybunion Beach are your best bets, especially around the tides from 08:49 to 16:31. Tomorrow, swell builds slightly to 3 ft @ 11s W with similar ENE winds, keeping it clean at the same spots. Day after, conditions remain steady at 3 ft @ 9s WSW, but winds shift to SE, still providing workable waves. Best: tomorrow.
