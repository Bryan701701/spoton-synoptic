Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it’s a quiet day with no surf action—wrong swell angle and fresh onshore winds have it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions remain poor with 6 ft @9s W swell but stronger 28 mph SSW winds, keeping it messy. Day after, we see a bump to 10 ft @12s W, but with similar winds at 16 mph SW, only select spots like Ballybunion Left and Mossies may offer some workable waves. Best: day after.
