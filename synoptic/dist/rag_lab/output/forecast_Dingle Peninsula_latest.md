Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it's looking good with 8 ft @10s W swell and a moderate 12 mph WSW wind. Best spots include Ballybunion Right and Ballybunion Beach, both working well from 08:43 to 16:24. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 8 ft @12s W swell and a light shift to 13 mph SSW wind, but some spots may struggle. The day after, expect a drop to 10 ft @10s SW with fresh 32 mph SSW winds, likely making it blown out. Best: today.
