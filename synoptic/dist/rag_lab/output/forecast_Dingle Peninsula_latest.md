Dingle Peninsula is lighting up today with solid surf: 12 ft @ 14s W and light E winds at 11 mph. Ballybunion Left, Garywilliam Point, and Mossies are all working well, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow sees a drop to 7 ft @ 11s WNW with moderate NNE winds at 15 mph, still offering some fun at the right spots. The day after continues the trend with 5 ft @ 11s W, but winds pick up slightly to 16 mph NNE. Best: today.
