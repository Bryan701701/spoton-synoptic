Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it's flat with no surf action—just calm waters. Tomorrow, conditions improve with swell at 8 ft @ 11s WSW and light winds at 11 mph W, making for some fun waves at spots like Mossies and Coumeenole. The day after, swell holds at 9 ft @ 12s W but with fresh winds at 15 mph, so look for sheltered corners to catch some rides. Best: tomorrow.
