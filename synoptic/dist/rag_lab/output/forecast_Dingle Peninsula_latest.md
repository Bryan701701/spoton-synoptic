Dingle Peninsula is looking fun today with 2 ft @11s WNW swell and fresh 14 mph E winds. Ballybunion Right and Ballybunion Beach are your best bets, especially on the push from 08:49 to 16:32. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 2 ft @10s WNW and 17 mph SE winds; still workable at the same spots. By the day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @9s WNW with lighter 9 mph NW winds, making it a cleaner option. Best: day after.
