Today on the Dingle Peninsula, conditions are poor with 0 ft @ 0 s and no surfable options. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 16 ft @ 14 s from the WSW, but fresh 35 mph winds will keep it blown out. By the day after, conditions improve with 7 ft @ 10 s WSW, and while the wind eases to 18 mph, there are still some workable spots like Ballybunion. Best: day after.
