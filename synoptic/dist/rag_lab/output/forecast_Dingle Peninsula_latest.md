Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it's looking fun with 3 ft @10s WNW swell and fresh 17 mph ENE winds. Ballybunion Right and Ballybunion Beach are your best bets, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell remains steady at 3 ft but with a slightly longer period of 11s, and winds ease to 14 mph, keeping it workable. By the day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @11s, but still offers some rideable waves at spots like Coumeenole and Inch Strand. Best: today.
