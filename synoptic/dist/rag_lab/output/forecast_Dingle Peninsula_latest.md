Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it's a quiet scene with no surf producing—wrong swell angle and fresh 26 mph WSW wind. Tomorrow sees a slight increase in swell to 13 ft @12s WNW, but still blown out with 19 mph W wind. The day after, conditions remain poor with 9 ft @11s W swell and fresh 24 mph WNW winds. Best: none.
