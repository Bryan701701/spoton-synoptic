Today on the Dingle Peninsula, conditions are poor with a swell of 5 ft @ 7s from the N and fresh 20 mph NNE winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 4 ft @ 7s from the NW, but the fresh 23 mph WSW winds will keep it messy. On the day after, the swell bumps back to 5 ft @ 8s from the NW, with winds easing to 19 mph NNW, but still not ideal. Best: day after.
