Today on the Dingle Peninsula, conditions are poor with a strong 26 mph SSW wind and a hefty 7 ft @ 8s SW swell, making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell increases to 10 ft @ 10s SW, but the fresh 27 mph SW wind continues to chop things up, keeping it messy. By the day after, conditions improve with 8 ft @ 11s WNW swell and lighter 10 mph NNW winds, offering some clean options at spots like Ballybunion Left and Garywilliam Point. Best: day after.
