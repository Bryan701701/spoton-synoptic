Today on the Dingle Peninsula, conditions are poor with a hefty 7 ft @9s W swell but fresh 28 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell increases to 10 ft @13s W, but the wind remains fresh at 20 mph WSW, keeping it messy. By the day after, the swell holds at 10 ft @13s W with lighter 14 mph SW winds, offering some workable options at spots like Ballybunion Left and Mossies during the tide windows. Best: day after.
