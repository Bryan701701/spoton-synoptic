Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it's looking poor with 10 ft @10s WSW swell and fresh 24 mph SW winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell increases to 15 ft @15s but with stronger 26 mph S winds, keeping conditions messy. The day after, it remains at 15 ft @14s with even fresher 29 mph W winds, still not producing any workable surf. Best: none.
