Today on the Causeway Coast, it’s looking great with 4 ft @ 12s WNW swell and light 4 mph E winds. White Park Bay and Portballintrae are both firing, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 11s NW with fresh 16 mph E winds, making it a bit choppy but still surfable at those same spots. The day after, conditions ease with 2 ft @ 10s NW swell, and Portballintrae remains the pick of the day. Best: today.
