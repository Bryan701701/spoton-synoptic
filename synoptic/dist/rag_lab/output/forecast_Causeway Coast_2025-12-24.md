Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking great with 4 ft @ 12s WNW swell and light 4 mph E winds. White Park Bay and Portballintrae are both firing, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 11s NW with fresh 16 mph E winds, making it a bit choppy, but still surfable. The day after, expect smaller 2 ft @ 10s NW swell at Portballintrae, with similar winds. Best: today.
