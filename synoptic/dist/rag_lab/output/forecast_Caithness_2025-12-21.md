Today in Caithness, it's looking solid with 6 ft @ 15s W swell and a moderate 15 mph SE wind. Point of Ness and Murkle Point are your best bets, especially between 09:03 and 14:48. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @ 12s WNW with fresh 19 mph ESE winds, making it a bit poor across the board. The day after continues the trend with 4 ft @ 7s ESE and 21 mph SSE winds, keeping it less than ideal. Best: today.
