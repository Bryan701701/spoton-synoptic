Today in Caithness, it's looking solid with 6 ft @15s W swell and a moderate 15 mph SE wind. Best spots include Point of Ness and Murkle Point, both working well from 09:03 to 14:48. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @12s WNW with fresh 19 mph ESE winds, making it less appealing. By the day after, the swell continues to fade to 2 ft @10s WNW, with similar winds, so it’s not producing much. Best: today.
