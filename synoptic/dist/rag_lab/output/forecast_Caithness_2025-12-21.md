Today in Caithness, it's looking solid with 6 ft @15s W swell and a moderate 15 mph SE wind. Best spots include Point of Ness and Murkle Point, both working well from 09:03 to 14:48. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @12s WNW with fresh 19 mph ESE winds, making it a bit tricky. The day after, expect similar 4 ft @7s ESE but with stronger 21 mph SSE winds, likely keeping it messy. Best: today.
