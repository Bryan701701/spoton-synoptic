Today in Pembrokeshire, it's looking poor with 5 ft @8s SW swell but fresh 20 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly to 5 ft @9s SW with moderate 14 mph SSW winds, offering some workable options at spots like Whitesands Bay and Freshwater West. By the day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @10s WSW with light 9 mph NNW winds, creating clean conditions at various beaches. Best: day after.
