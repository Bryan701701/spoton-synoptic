Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a bit of a struggle with 5 ft @8s SW swell and fresh 20 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with the same swell height but a better period of 9s and lighter 14 mph SSW winds, making it more workable at spots like Whitesands Bay. By the day after, conditions clean up nicely with 2 ft @10s WSW swell and light 9 mph NNW winds, providing fun options at sheltered corners. Best: day after.
