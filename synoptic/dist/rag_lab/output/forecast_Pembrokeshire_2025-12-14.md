Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a bit rough with 5 ft @8s SW swell and fresh 20 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly to 5 ft @9s SW with moderate 14 mph SSW winds, so some sheltered spots may be workable. The day after looks promising with 2 ft @10s WSW and light 9 mph NNW winds, offering clean conditions at places like Whitesands Bay. Best: day after.
