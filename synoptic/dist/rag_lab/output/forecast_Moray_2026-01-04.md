Today in Moray, it's a bit of a struggle with fresh NW winds at 26 mph and a solid 7 ft @ 8s N swell, but all spots are blown out. Tomorrow sees a drop to 4 ft @ 6s N with continued 23 mph N winds, keeping conditions poor. By the day after, things improve slightly with 2 ft @ 7s NNE and lighter 12 mph SSE winds, making it workable at sheltered corners like Banff and Fraserburgh. Best: day after.
