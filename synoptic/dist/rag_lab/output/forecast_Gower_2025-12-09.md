Today, Gower is not producing with 10 ft @10s SW swell and fresh 35 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions remain poor with 8 ft @10s WSW swell and 21 mph SW winds, still not workable. Day after, the swell drops to 6 ft @10s WSW, but the wind stays at 21 mph S, keeping it messy. Best: none.
