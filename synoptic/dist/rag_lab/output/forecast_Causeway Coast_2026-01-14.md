Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking solid with 5 ft @9s NW swell and light 11 mph S winds. White Park Bay and Portballintrae are the top picks, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @10s with fresh 20 mph SSW winds, making it poor across the board. The day after continues the trend with 4 ft @14s, but winds shift to 19 mph SE, keeping it messy. Best: today.
