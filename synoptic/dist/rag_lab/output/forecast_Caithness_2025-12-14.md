Today in Caithness, it's looking solid with 6 ft @10s W swell and a fresh 15 mph WSW wind. Points like Point of Ness and Murkle Point are clean and fun, especially during the morning and mid-day tides. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with the same swell height but a shift to 17 mph S winds—still workable at the same spots. Day after, expect 6 ft @12s W swell with 18 mph SW winds, keeping the surf lively. Best: today.
