Today in Caithness, it’s looking solid with 6 ft @10s W swell and fresh 15 mph WSW winds. Best spots include Point of Ness and Murkle Point, both offering fun waves from early through mid-day. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 6 ft @10s W but winds shift to 17 mph S, still keeping it workable at the same spots. Day after, expect a slight bump in period to 12s with similar swell height, making for some punchy rides. Best: today.
