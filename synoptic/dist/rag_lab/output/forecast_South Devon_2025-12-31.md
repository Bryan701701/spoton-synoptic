Today in South Devon, it's looking poor with 2 ft @6s SE swell and fresh 18 mph ENE wind creating some chop. Tomorrow drops to 1 ft @8s SW with light 3 mph NNW winds, making it a quiet day. The day after continues the trend with 1 ft @5s WNW and calm 3 mph N winds, so not much happening. Best: today.
