Today in South Devon, it's looking poor with 2 ft @6s SE swell and fresh 18 mph ENE wind, making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 1 ft @8s SW with light 3 mph NNW winds, leaving it quite flat. Day after continues the trend with 1 ft @5s WNW and calm 3 mph N winds, so not much happening. Best: today.
