Today in North Yorks, it's looking fun with 3 ft @6s E swell and a fresh 16 mph ESE wind. Withernsea and Filey are your best bets, both offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 3 ft @6s E and a slightly lighter 13 mph E wind, keeping the surf enjoyable. By the day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @5s E, but the wind shifts to 14 mph ENE, still providing workable waves. Best: today.
