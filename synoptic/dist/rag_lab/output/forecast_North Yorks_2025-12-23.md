Today in North Yorks, surf is fun at 3 ft @ 6s with a fresh 16 mph ESE wind. Withernsea and Filey are your top picks, both working well throughout the day. Tomorrow, expect similar conditions with 3 ft @ 6s and slightly lighter 13 mph E winds, still keeping it clean. On the day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 5s, but the wind shifts to 14 mph ENE, making it a bit choppy. Best: today.
