Today, Saltburn Beach is showing some fun with 2 ft @ 6s SSE and fresh 17 mph SW winds. It’s a bit choppy, but sheltered corners are still workable. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 1 ft @ 4s, making it a quiet day with little action. The day after remains similar, with 1 ft @ 5s, so not much to ride. Best: today.
