The South is looking great today with clean 4 ft @ 7s SSW swell and light 9 mph SW winds. Best spots include Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane, both offering solid conditions from morning till late afternoon. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 4 ft but the wind picks up to 14 mph WSW, making it a bit choppy but still workable at sheltered corners. By the day after, the swell drops slightly to 3 ft, but it's still fun for a session. Best: today.
