Today, the South is looking fun with 5 ft @7s SSW swell and a moderate 13 mph SW wind. Spots like Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane are your best bets, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 4 ft @8s SSW and lighter 9 mph SW winds, making it a great day to hit the waves. The day after, expect 3 ft @8s SW with a light 10 mph W wind, still offering some fun options. Best: tomorrow.
