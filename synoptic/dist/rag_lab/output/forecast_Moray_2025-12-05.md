Today in Moray, it's a quiet scene with 2 ft @6s E swell and fresh 22 mph SE winds. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with 5 ft @6s ESE swell but strong 32 mph SE winds making it blown out. The day after brings a nice turnaround with 3 ft @8s ENE swell and light 8 mph SSE winds, offering clean waves at spots like Fraserburgh and Lossiemouth. Best: day after.
