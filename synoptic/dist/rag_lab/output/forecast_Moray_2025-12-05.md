Today in Moray, surf is on the smaller side at 2 ft @6s with fresh 22 mph SE winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with 5 ft @6s ESE swell but strong 32 mph SE winds will keep it messy. The day after brings a cleaner 3 ft @8s ENE swell with light 8 mph SSE winds, making it the best day for surf. Best: day after.
