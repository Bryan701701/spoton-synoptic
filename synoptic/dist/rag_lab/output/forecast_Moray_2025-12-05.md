Today in Moray, it's a bit of a bummer with poor conditions—2 ft @6s E and fresh 22 mph SE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 5 ft @6s ESE, but the wind ramps up to a fresh 32 mph SE, keeping it messy. By the day after, things improve with clean 3 ft @8s ENE waves and light 8 mph SSE winds, making it a fun day for a surf. Best: day after.
