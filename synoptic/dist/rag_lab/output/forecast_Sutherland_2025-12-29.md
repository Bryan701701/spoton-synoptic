Today in Sutherland, surf is looking fun with 4 ft @ 11s NNW and a light 11 mph SW wind. Good spots like Melvich and Strathy are working well, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, expect a slight bump to 5 ft @ 12s N with a gentle 6 mph SE breeze, making it a great day for a surf session at Armadale Bay or Sango Bay. On the day after, conditions shift with 4 ft @ 8s NNW but fresh 26 mph W winds will likely chop things up, leaving Sango Bay as the standout. Best: tomorrow.
