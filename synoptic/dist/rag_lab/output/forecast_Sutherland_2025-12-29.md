Sutherland is lighting up today with 4 ft @ 11s NNW swell and a moderate 11 mph SW wind. Great options at Melvich and Strathy, both holding shape nicely throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 5 ft @ 12s N with light 6 mph SE winds, keeping it clean and fun at spots like Sango Bay. By the day after, expect 4 ft @ 8s NNW with fresh 26 mph W winds, making it a bit challenging, but Sango Bay could still offer some workable waves. Best: tomorrow.
