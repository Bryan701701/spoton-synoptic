Today, South Devon is quiet with no surf, as the swell isn’t hitting this coast. Tomorrow, there's a slight increase to 2 ft @5s, but fresh 26 mph NW winds will make it blown out. The day after also sees 2 ft @6s, but with lighter 5 mph WSW winds, offering a better chance for some workable conditions. Best: day after.
