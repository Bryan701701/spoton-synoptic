Today, The South is lighting up with clean 5 ft @8s SSW swell and light 5 mph WNW winds. Spots like Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane are prime, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @9s SW with light 2 mph NW winds, still offering some fun at the same locations. Day after, conditions take a turn with fresh 28 mph SSW winds, making it blown out and poor across the board. Best: today.
