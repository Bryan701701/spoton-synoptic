Today, The South is lighting up with clean 5 ft @ 8s SSW swell and light 5 mph WNW winds. Spots like Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane are prime for action, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 9s SW, but it remains fun with light 2 mph NW winds. Day after, expect a poor day with 5 ft @ 7s SSW swell, but strong 28 mph SSW winds will make it blown out. Best: today.
