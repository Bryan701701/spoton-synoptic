Today in Caithness, it’s a solid day with 5 ft @ 13s NW swell and light 8 mph SW winds. Point of Ness and Murkle Point are both firing, especially during the tide windows from 09:40–11:29 and 12:59–16:25. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @ 11s NW with fresh 17 mph SSE winds, making it a bit choppy but still surfable at spots like The Point and Dunnet Bay. Day after, we see 3 ft @ 10s NNW with 11 mph SE winds, offering fun waves at sheltered spots. Best: today.
