Today in Caithness, it's looking great with 5 ft @ 13s NW swell and light 8 mph SW winds. Point of Ness and Murkle Point are prime spots, especially around the tide windows of 09:40–11:29 and 12:59–16:25. Tomorrow, conditions drop a bit to 4 ft @ 11s NW with fresh 17 mph SSE winds, but still some fun waves at spots like The Point and Dunnet Bay. Day after, swell eases to 3 ft @ 10s NNW, but with light 11 mph SE winds, it should be clean and enjoyable. Best: today.
