Today in Caithness, it’s looking fantastic with 5 ft @ 13s NW swell and light 8 mph SW winds. Point of Ness and Murkle Point are prime spots, especially during the tides from 09:40 to 11:29 and 12:59 to 16:25. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 4 ft @ 11s NW with fresh 17 mph SSE winds, making it a bit choppy but still workable at spots like The Point and Dunnet Bay. By the day after, conditions improve again with 3 ft @ 10s NNW swell and light 11 mph SE winds, perfect for a fun session at The Cove or Sandside Bay. Best: today.
