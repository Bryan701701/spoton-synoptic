Today in Caithness, it's looking great with 5 ft @ 13s NW swell and light 8 mph SW winds. Spots like Point of Ness and Murkle Point are firing, especially during the tide windows from 09:40–11:29 and 12:59–16:25. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 4 ft @ 11s NW, with fresh 17 mph SSE winds making it a bit choppy, but still workable at spots like Dunnet Bay.
