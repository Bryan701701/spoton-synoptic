Today in Caithness, it's looking great with 5 ft @ 13s NW swell and light 8 mph SW winds. Best spots include Point of Ness and Murkle Point, both firing from 09:40 to 11:29 and again from 12:59 to 16:25. Tomorrow, conditions drop slightly to 4 ft @ 11s NW with fresh 17 mph SSE winds, making it a bit choppy but still workable at various spots. Day after, expect 3 ft @ 10s NNW swell with lighter 11 mph SE winds, providing a fun session at places like The Point and Sandside Bay. Best: today.
