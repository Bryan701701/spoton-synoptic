Today in Caithness, it's looking great with 5 ft @ 13s NW swell and a light 8 mph SW wind. Point of Ness and Murkle Point are both firing, especially during the tide windows from 09:40 to 11:29 and 12:59 to 16:25. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @ 11s NW with a fresh 17 mph SSE wind, making it a bit choppy but still workable at spots like Dunnet Bay. On the day after, expect 3 ft @ 10s NNW with a lighter 11 mph SE wind, keeping it fun at places like The Point. Best: today.
