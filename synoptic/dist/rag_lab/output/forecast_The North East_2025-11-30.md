Today in the North East, we're looking at solid conditions with 5 ft @ 8s N swell and fresh 16 mph WNW winds. Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach are prime spots, especially around their tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 4 ft @ 8s NNE with moderate 15 mph S winds, still offering fun waves at various beaches. By the day after, the surf eases to 2 ft @ 10s NNE, but with lighter winds, it should be clean and enjoyable at sheltered corners like Coatham Sands and Hartlepool. Best: today.
