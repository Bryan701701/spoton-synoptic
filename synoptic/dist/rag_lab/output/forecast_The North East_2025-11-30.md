Today, the North East is lighting up with 5 ft @ 8s N swell and fresh 16 mph WNW winds. Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach are both prime spots, especially around their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @ 8s NNE, with winds shifting to 15 mph S, still offering some fun at various breaks. By the day after, conditions ease further to 2 ft @ 10s NNE, with lighter winds making for a more relaxed surf day. Best: today.
