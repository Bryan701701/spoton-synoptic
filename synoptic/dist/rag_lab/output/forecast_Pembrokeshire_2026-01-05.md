Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a quiet scene with 1 ft @ 6s NW swell and light 2 mph SSW winds—definitely not producing. Tomorrow, the swell remains at 1 ft but drops to a short 4s period with fresh 12 mph WNW winds, keeping it blown out. On the day after, conditions pick up to 4 ft @ 6s WNW but with fresh 21 mph NW winds, making it messy. Best: day after.
