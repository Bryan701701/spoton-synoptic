Today in Sutherland, surf is looking solid with 3 ft @ 12s W and light SSE winds at 9 mph. Melvich and Strathy are both firing, with prime tides for catching waves. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 9s WNW, and while Balnakeil and Oldshoremore will still have some action, expect a fresh NNE wind at 18 mph to make it a bit choppy. Day after, conditions improve again with 3 ft @ 9s NNW and light SSE winds, making it a great time to hit spots like Melvich and Sango Bay. Best: today.
