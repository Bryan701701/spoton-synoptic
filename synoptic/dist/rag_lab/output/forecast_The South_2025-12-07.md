Today, the South is looking fun with 4 ft @8s SSW swell and a fresh 14 mph S wind. Spots like Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane are clean and working well, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 5 ft @9s SSW, with moderate 16 mph SW winds, keeping it lively across the coast. However, the day after brings a hefty 10 ft @9s S swell with strong 40 mph S winds, making it poor conditions. Best: tomorrow.
