Today in Cornwall, the North coast is lighting up with 6ft @12s W swell and fresh 17 mph SW winds. Crantock and Fistral are your best bets, especially early on the push. Tomorrow, expect similar conditions with a slight drop in period to 10s, but still 6ft swell—great for a fun session. By the day after, the swell rises to 9ft but with strong winds making it blown out. Best: today.
