Today on the Dingle Peninsula, surf is looking fun with 7 ft @10s WSW swell and a moderate 15 mph W wind. Best spots include Ballybunion Right and Ballybunion Beach, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow brings a significant increase to 11 ft @11s WSW, but fresh 26 mph SSW winds will make it poor across the board. The day after, conditions worsen further with 14 ft @11s SSW and strong 35 mph S winds. Best: today.
