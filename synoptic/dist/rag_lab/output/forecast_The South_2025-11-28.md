Today, the South is quiet with a fresh 30 mph SW wind on 4 ft @ 7s SW swell, making for a blown-out situation. Tomorrow, conditions improve with a clean 3 ft @ 8s SSW swell and light 5 mph WNW winds, offering fun waves at spots like Ballinskelligs Bay. The day after, the swell drops to 1 ft @ 8s SW with similar light winds, keeping it small and workable only at select spots. Best: tomorrow.
