Today in County Clare, it's flat with no surf on the horizon; the swell isn't hitting this coast. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 4 ft @ 11s W and light 8 mph SE winds, making for clean surf at spots like Doolin Point and Lahinch Beach. The day after, the swell picks up to 7 ft @ 11s WSW, but fresh 24 mph SSW winds will make it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
