Today in County Clare, it's a no-go with 9 ft @12s W swell and fresh 34 mph W winds creating a blown-out mess. Tomorrow looks much better as conditions improve with 4 ft @11s W swell and light 8 mph SE winds, making spots like Doolin Point and Lahinch Beach fun and workable. The day after, swell increases to 7 ft @11s WSW but with fresh 24 mph SSW winds, leading to poor conditions again. Best: tomorrow.
