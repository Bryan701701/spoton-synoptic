Today in Donegal, we’re looking at solid surf with 4 ft @ 11s WNW at spots like Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty, with a light E wind at 12 mph keeping it clean. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 11s W, still workable but less punchy, with fresh E winds at 13 mph. By the day after, it remains around 2 ft @ 9s WNW, with a bit more breeze at 15 mph ENE, but still fun at sheltered spots. Best: today.
