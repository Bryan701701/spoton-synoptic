Today in Donegal, it’s a solid 4 ft @ 11s WNW with a moderate 12 mph E wind. Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are your top picks, both offering fun waves from 08:58 to 16:07. Tomorrow drops to 2 ft @ 11s W, still workable at the same spots, but expect a fresh 13 mph E wind. By the day after, conditions remain similar with 2 ft @ 9s WNW and 15 mph ENE wind. Best: today.
