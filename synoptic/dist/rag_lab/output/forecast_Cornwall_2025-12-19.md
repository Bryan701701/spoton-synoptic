Today in Cornwall, it's a bit rough with fresh onshore winds at 20–25 mph, creating blown-out conditions across all coasts. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 5–7 ft but remains messy with strong winds. By the day after, conditions improve significantly with clean 6 ft @ 13s W waves and light ESE winds, making it a great day to hit the water. Best: day after.
