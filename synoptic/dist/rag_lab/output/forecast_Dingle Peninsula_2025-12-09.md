Today, the Dingle Peninsula is experiencing poor conditions with 12 ft @10s SW swell and fresh 38 mph SSE winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 11 ft @10s WSW, but the fresh 32 mph W winds will still keep things messy. On the day after, expect similar conditions with 12 ft @10s SW swell and stronger 46 mph S winds, continuing the trend of poor surf. Best: tomorrow.
