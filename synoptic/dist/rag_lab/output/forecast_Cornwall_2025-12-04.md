Today, South is looking decent with Porthcurno and Praa Sands offering 8 ft @8s W swell and 16 mph WNW winds. Best windows are during the early tides from 09:03–15:06, and again later from 16:36–17:21. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @9s WSW with similar winds, making it less appealing. Day after, the swell picks up to 12 ft @12s W but will be blown out by fresh WSW winds. Best: today.
