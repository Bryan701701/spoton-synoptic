Today in North Devon, it's looking pretty quiet with 2 ft @8s NNW swell and a fresh 9 mph E wind. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with 2 ft @6s ENE swell and a strong 35 mph ENE wind, making it blown out. On the day after, the swell picks up slightly to 3 ft @5s NE, but the 28 mph NE wind will still keep it choppy. Best: today.
