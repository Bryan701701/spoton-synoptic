Today in North Devon, the surf is small and not producing, with 2 ft @8s NNW across all spots and fresh 9 mph E winds creating some chop. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with 2 ft @6s ENE and strong 35 mph ENE winds, making it blown out. On the day after, the swell picks up slightly to 3 ft @5s NE, but the 28 mph NE winds will still keep it messy. Best: today.
