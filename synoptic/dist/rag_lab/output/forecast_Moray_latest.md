Today in Moray, conditions are poor with 3 ft @ 5s SE swell and fresh 36 mph SSE winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow remains similar with 3 ft @ 6s SSE swell and 21 mph S winds, still not producing. Day after, the swell picks up slightly to 4 ft @ 6s WNW, but the 13 mph SW wind keeps it messy. Best: day after.
