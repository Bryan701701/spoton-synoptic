Today in Moray, it's a quiet scene with 3 ft @8s E swell but fresh 20 mph SSE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 3 ft @5s SE, but the winds pick up to a fresh 34 mph SSE, keeping conditions poor. Day after, the swell continues to fade to 2 ft @4s SE with 21 mph S winds, still not ideal. Best: today.
