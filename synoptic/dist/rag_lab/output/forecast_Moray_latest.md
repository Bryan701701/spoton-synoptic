Today in Moray, conditions are poor with a weak 2 ft @6s E swell and fresh 22 mph SE winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 5 ft @6s ESE swell, but the wind picks up to a strong 32 mph SE, keeping it messy. The day after brings a welcome change with 3 ft @8s ENE swell and light 8 mph SSE winds, offering clean and workable waves at spots like Fraserburgh and Lossiemouth. Best: day after.
