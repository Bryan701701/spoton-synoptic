Today in Moray, it's a quiet scene with 1 ft @4s WSW swell and fresh 11 mph SSW winds. Tomorrow sees a slight increase to 2 ft @3s S, but the fresh SSE winds will keep it messy. By the day after, conditions drop back to 1 ft @4s SW with moderate 14 mph SSW winds, still not producing anything worthwhile. Best: tomorrow.
