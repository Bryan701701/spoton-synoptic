Today in Moray, clean conditions with 2 ft @ 7s NNE swell and moderate 11 mph SSE winds. Fraserburgh and Pennan are your best bets, both working well from morning into the afternoon. Tomorrow, expect a bit more size with 3 ft @ 7s ENE swell and light 5 mph NE winds, keeping it fun across the coast. Day after, conditions drop back to 2 ft @ 7s E with fresh 12 mph S winds, but Spey Bay and Lossiemouth will still have some workable waves. Best: tomorrow.
