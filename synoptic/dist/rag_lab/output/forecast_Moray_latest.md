Today in Moray, it’s a flat day with no surf at all—0 ft @5s across the board. Tomorrow looks similar, with the swell still not hitting; it remains flat at 0 ft @4s. However, day after brings a welcome change with 2 ft @7s NE swell, clean conditions, and light WSW winds at spots like Fraserburgh and Banff. Best: day after.
