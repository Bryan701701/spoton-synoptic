Today in Moray, the surf is flat with no swell hitting, so it's a quiet day. Tomorrow, expect a bit of a bump with 5 ft @6s ESE, but fresh 32 mph SE winds will make it blown out. The day after, conditions improve with 3 ft @8s ENE and light 8 mph SSE winds, making it a fun day at spots like Fraserburgh and Lossiemouth. Best: day after.
