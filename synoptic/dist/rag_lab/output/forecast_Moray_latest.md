Today in Moray, it's a bit rough with 6 ft @7s ENE swell and fresh 24 mph E winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly to 2 ft @8s with moderate 15 mph S winds, offering some workable options at spots like Fraserburgh and Lossiemouth. The day after, we're looking at 3 ft @6s with light 9 mph NNE winds, making for a fun surf day. Best: day after.
