Today in Moray, it's a bit rough with fresh NNW winds at 23 mph and 4 ft @ 7s NNE swell across the board. No good spots are working, so it’s best to give it a miss. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 3 ft @ 6s E swell and lighter SSE winds at 17 mph, making it more workable at places like Fraserburgh and Lossiemouth. The day after, conditions clean up nicely with 2 ft @ 10s NNE swell and light SE winds, especially at Spey Bay and Lossiemouth. Best: day after.
