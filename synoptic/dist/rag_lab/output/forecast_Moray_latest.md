Today in Moray, it’s a bit of a bummer with poor conditions—3 ft @6s SSE and fresh 25 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow brings a slight improvement with 2 ft @8s ENE at Spey Bay and Lossiemouth, with lighter 11 mph SSW winds; a fun day for a paddle! The day after, conditions drop again to 2 ft @5s W, with fresh 23 mph WSW winds keeping it choppy. Best: tomorrow.
