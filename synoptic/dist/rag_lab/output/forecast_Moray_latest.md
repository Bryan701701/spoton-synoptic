Today in Moray, Spey Bay and Lossiemouth are both clean and fun at 2 ft @ 9s NNE with light 7 mph WSW winds. Best surf times are from 09:32 to 16:31, so make the most of it! Tomorrow, conditions drop to 1 ft @ 6s ESE with fresh 22 mph SSE winds, making it a day to skip. The day after, similar 1 ft @ 7s E waves continue with 14 mph SSE winds; still not ideal. Best: today.
