Today in Moray, it’s a bit of a struggle with weak 2 ft @4s SW lines and fresh 15 mph SSW wind. Tomorrow looks similar, with the same 2 ft @4s WSW swell and 13 mph SSW wind. However, day after brings a small improvement with 1 ft @9s NE at Spey Bay and Lossiemouth, making it more workable. Best: day after.
