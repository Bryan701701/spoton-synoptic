Today, Moray is seeing some hefty swell at 7 ft @8s from the N, but fresh 26 mph NW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @6s, still messy with 23 mph N winds. By the day after, conditions improve slightly with 2 ft @7s NNE swell and lighter 12 mph SSE winds, making it workable at sheltered spots like Banff. Best: day after.
