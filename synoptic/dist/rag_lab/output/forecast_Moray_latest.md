Today in Moray, it’s looking poor with 6 ft @7s N swell, but fresh 30 mph NNW winds are making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, similar conditions persist with 6 ft @8s N swell and fresh 31 mph NW winds, keeping it messy. By the day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @6s N with slightly lighter 19 mph NNW winds, but it remains poor overall. Best: none.
