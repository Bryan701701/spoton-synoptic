Today in Moray, it's a bit of a struggle with 6 ft @7s ENE swell and fresh 24 mph E winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 2 ft @8s E swell and moderate 15 mph S winds, offering some workable conditions at spots like Fraserburgh and Lossiemouth. By the day after, things get better with 3 ft @6s E swell and light 9 mph NNE winds, creating fun waves at various beaches. Best: day after.
