Today in Moray, it's a fun day with clean 2 ft @ 7s lines from the NNE and a moderate 11 mph SSE wind. Best spots include Fraserburgh and Pennan, both working well from morning into the afternoon. Tomorrow, expect a slight bump to 3 ft @ 7s with light NE winds, keeping conditions tidy across the coast. On the day after, surf drops back to 2 ft @ 7s with a fresh S wind, but Spey Bay and Lossiemouth will still have some workable waves. Best: tomorrow.
