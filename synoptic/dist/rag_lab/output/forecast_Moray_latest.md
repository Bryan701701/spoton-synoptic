Today in Moray, it's a bit rough with fresh NW winds at 26 mph and 7 ft @ 8s N swell, making for blown-out conditions. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 4 ft @ 6s N, but the fresh N wind at 23 mph keeps it messy. By the day after, conditions improve slightly to 2 ft @ 7s NNE with lighter SSE winds, offering some workable waves at sheltered spots like Banff. Best: day after.
