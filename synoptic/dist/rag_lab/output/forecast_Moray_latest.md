Today in Moray, Spey Bay and Lossiemouth are both offering fun 2 ft @6s E waves with a moderate 13 mph SSW wind. Best conditions are on the push from 08:42 to 15:26. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 1 ft @5s, making it a quiet day across the coast. The day after, we see a slight increase to 3 ft @4s, but fresh 30 mph SSW winds will make it blown out. Best: today.
