Today in Moray, conditions are poor with a swell of 3 ft @ 5s from the SE and fresh 36 mph SSE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell remains at 3 ft @ 6s, but the wind eases to 21 mph from the S, still not ideal. The day after sees a slight increase to 4 ft @ 6s from the WNW with 13 mph SW winds, offering a bit more potential but still not great. Best: day after.
