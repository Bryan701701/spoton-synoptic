Today in Moray, it's a bit rough with 3 ft @5s ESE swell and fresh 36 mph ESE winds. Not much working here, so best to give it a miss. Tomorrow sees a nice improvement with 2 ft @8s ENE swell and light 9 mph SW winds, making for clean conditions at spots like Fraserburgh and Lossiemouth. Day after, conditions remain decent but with slightly weaker 2 ft @7s ENE swell and moderate 12 mph SSW winds, still offering some fun at Spey Bay and Lossiemouth. Best: tomorrow.
