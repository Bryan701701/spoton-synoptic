Today in Moray, it's a quiet scene with 1 ft @ 4s W across all spots, and fresh 12 mph SSW winds creating a bit of chop. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 1 ft @ 3s WSW and slightly stronger winds at 13 mph SSW, keeping it flat and uninviting. The day after, the swell continues to struggle at 1 ft @ 3s SSE, with fresh 29 mph SSE winds making it blown out. Best: today.
