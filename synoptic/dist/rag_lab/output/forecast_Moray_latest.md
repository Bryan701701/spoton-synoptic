Today in Moray, it's a fun 2 ft @ 8s NNE with a moderate 11 mph W wind. Fraserburgh and Pennan are your best bets, both working nicely throughout the day. Tomorrow, we see a solid increase to 4 ft @ 10s NNE, still with a light N wind, making for some exciting conditions at multiple spots. On the day after, conditions drop to 3 ft @ 8s N with fresh 28 mph W winds, making it blown out across the board. Best: tomorrow.
