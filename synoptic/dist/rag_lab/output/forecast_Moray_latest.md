Today in Moray, it's a bit of a bummer with 2 ft @5s WSW swell and fresh 13 mph S winds making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 1 ft @11s NNE, still not producing much, but Spey Bay and Lossiemouth might offer a little fun for those keen. The day after, conditions worsen with similar 2 ft @5s WSW swell but with stronger 23 mph S winds, making it poor everywhere again. Best: tomorrow.
