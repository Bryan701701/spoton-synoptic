Today in Moray, we've got 2 ft @ 6s NNW with fresh 17 mph NNW winds. Fraserburgh and Pennan are your best bets, offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @ 7s NNE, but fresh 21 mph winds will make it blown out across the board. Day after, we see a slight improvement back to 3 ft @ 7s ENE with lighter 16 mph SSE winds, making it more workable. Best: today.
