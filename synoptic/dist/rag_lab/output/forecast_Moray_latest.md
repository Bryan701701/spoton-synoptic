Today in Moray, conditions are poor with 3 ft @9s N swell, but fresh 28 mph W winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow sees an increase to 7 ft @7s NNW, yet the fresh 36 mph NW winds will keep it messy. The day after brings even bigger waves at 8 ft @8s N, but with 21 mph NNE winds, it remains challenging. Best: day after.
