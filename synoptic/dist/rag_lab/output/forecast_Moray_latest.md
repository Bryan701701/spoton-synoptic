Today in Moray, Spey Bay and Lossiemouth are both lighting up with 2 ft @ 9s NNE swell and light 7 mph WSW winds. Perfect conditions for a fun session, especially during the tide windows from 09:32 to 16:30. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 1 ft @ 6s with fresh 22 mph SSE winds, making it a day to skip. Day after, similar 1 ft @ 7s with 14 mph SSE winds, still not ideal. Best: today.
