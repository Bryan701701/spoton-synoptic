Today in Moray, it's a bit of a struggle with 2 ft @6s E swell and fresh 22 mph SE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a bump to 5 ft @6s ESE, but with stronger 32 mph SE winds, it’ll still be messy. Day after brings cleaner conditions with 3 ft @8s ENE and light 8 mph SSE winds, making it the best day to catch some fun waves. Best: day after.
