Today in Moray, it's a bit of a struggle with fresh 23 mph NNW winds creating blown-out conditions and a 4 ft @ 7s NNE swell. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 3 ft @ 6s E swell and 17 mph SSE winds, but still not ideal. By the day after, conditions clean up a bit with 2 ft @ 10s NNE swell and light 6 mph SE winds, making it more workable at spots like Spey Bay and Lossiemouth. Best: day after.
