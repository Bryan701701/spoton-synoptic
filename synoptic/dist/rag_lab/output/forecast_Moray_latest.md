Today in Moray, it's looking fun with 3 ft @7s NNE swell and light 6 mph ENE winds. Fraserburgh and Pennan are both clean and working well, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @7s, but still manageable with 10 mph SW winds, keeping it playful at spots like Banff and Lossiemouth. Day after, expect poor conditions with 3 ft @5s N swell and fresh 26 mph NW winds, making it blown out across the board. Best: today.
