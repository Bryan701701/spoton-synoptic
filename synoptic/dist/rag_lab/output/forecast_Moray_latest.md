Today in Moray, both Spey Bay and Lossiemouth are lighting up with 2 ft @ 9s NNE swell, complemented by a light 7 mph WSW wind. Ideal conditions are on the push from 09:32 to 16:31. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 1 ft @ 6s ESE with fresh 22 mph SSE winds, making it a day to skip. The day after, still 1 ft @ 7s E with similar winds, remains uninviting. Best: today.
