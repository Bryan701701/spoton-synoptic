Today in Moray, it's a bit rough with 6 ft @7s NNW swell and fresh 31 mph NW wind, making it blown out and not producing. Tomorrow, the swell remains at 6 ft @8s N but shifts to a fresh 27 mph ENE wind, keeping conditions poor. The day after sees a slight increase to 7 ft @7s N with 24 mph N wind, still not ideal. Best: none.
