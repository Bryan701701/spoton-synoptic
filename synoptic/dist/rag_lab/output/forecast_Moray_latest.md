Today in Moray, Fraserburgh is showing some fun with 3 ft @ 7s E and fresh 17 mph SSE winds. It’s a bit choppy, but still workable, especially during the tide window from 09:26 to 16:27. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2 ft @ 8s NNE with similar winds, but Spey Bay and Lossiemouth could offer some options. Day after looks flat with 1 ft @ 6s ESE and fresh SSE winds, so best to give it a miss. Best: today.
