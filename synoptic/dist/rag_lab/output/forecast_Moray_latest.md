Today in Moray, it's clean and small with 1 ft @ 7s E swell and light 1 mph E winds. Spey Bay and Lossiemouth are your best bets, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 3 ft @ 8s E swell and moderate 17 mph SSE winds, making for some fun surf at several spots. The day after, winds pick up to 29 mph SSE, creating blown-out conditions across the region. Best: tomorrow.
