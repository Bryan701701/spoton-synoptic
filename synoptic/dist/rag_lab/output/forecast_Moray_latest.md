Today in Moray, Spey Bay and Lossiemouth are both offering fun, clean 1 ft @ 8s E swell with a light 9 mph SW wind. Ideal conditions for a mellow session, especially during the tides from 08:46 to 15:56. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2 ft @ 5s W with a fresh 27 mph WSW wind, making it blown out and not producing. The day after, we see a further decline to 1 ft @ 3s SSE with 15 mph SSW winds, keeping it poor across the board. Best: today.
