Today in Moray, Spey Bay and Lossiemouth are both clean and fun at 2 ft @ 9s NNE with light 7 mph WSW winds. Ideal conditions for a surf session, especially between 09:32 and 16:31. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 1 ft @ 6s ESE with fresh 22 mph SSE winds, making it a day to skip. The day after, similar small surf at 1 ft @ 7s E with 14 mph SSE winds, still not much to ride. Best: today.
