Today in Moray, we have some playful conditions with 1 ft @ 8s E swell and a moderate 13 mph SE wind. Spey Bay and Lossiemouth are your best bets, both working well during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell picks up slightly to 2 ft @ 5s E, but fresh 23 mph SE winds will make it blown out and less enjoyable. The day after continues the trend with 3 ft @ 5s E, but the wind ramps up to 27 mph SE, keeping it messy. Best: today.
