Today in Moray, it’s a quiet scene with 1 ft @ 4s SSW swell and fresh 24 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow remains similar, with 1 ft @ 4s WSW swell and light 9 mph SSE winds, but still not producing. The day after holds onto the same pattern with 1 ft @ 4s ESE swell and light 9 mph SE winds. Best: tomorrow.
