Today in Moray, it's looking pretty quiet with 1 ft @7s WNW across the board and a light 7 mph SSE wind. Tomorrow, conditions remain poor with 1 ft @4s ESE and fresh 23 mph ESE winds, making it blown out. On the day after, there's a slight improvement with 3 ft @6s E, but still a mix of poor spots; Fraserburgh is your best bet. Best: day after.
