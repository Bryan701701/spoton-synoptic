Today in Moray, it's looking great with 4 ft @10s NNE swell and a light 12 mph NNW wind. Fraserburgh and West Point are your top picks, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @8s NNW with fresh 32 mph W winds, making it blown out across the board. The day after, expect 6 ft @7s NNW but with strong 42 mph NW winds, keeping it poor. Best: today.
