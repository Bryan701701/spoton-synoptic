Today in Moray, it's a quiet one with 1 ft @4s NE swell and fresh 13 mph W wind. Tomorrow, conditions improve as the swell builds to 2 ft @7s NE with light 6 mph WSW winds, making it a great day for a surf session at spots like Banff or Fraserburgh. The day after, the swell remains at 2 ft @7s N but fresh 20 mph W winds will make it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
