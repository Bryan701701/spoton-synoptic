Today in Moray, it's a no-go with 7 ft @8s N swell and fresh 28 mph NNW winds creating blown-out conditions. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 6 ft @7s N swell and moderate 15 mph NNW winds, making for some workable waves at spots like Fraserburgh and West Point during the tide windows. Day after, conditions drop again to 6 ft @8s N with fresh 30 mph NNW winds, likely keeping things messy. Best: tomorrow.
