Today in Moray, conditions are on the poor side with 3 ft @8s E swell and fresh 20 mph SSE winds. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 3 ft @5s SE but the wind picks up to a strong 34 mph SSE, making it blown out. On the day after, the swell continues to decrease to 2 ft @4s SE with 21 mph S winds, still not ideal. Best: today.
