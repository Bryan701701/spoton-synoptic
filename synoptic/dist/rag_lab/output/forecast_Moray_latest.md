Today in Moray, it's a quiet one with 2 ft @6s E swell, but fresh 22 mph SE winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with 5 ft @6s ESE swell and stronger 32 mph SE winds, keeping it messy. By the day after, things improve to 3 ft @8s ENE with light 8 mph SSE winds, offering a fun surf day. Best: day after.
