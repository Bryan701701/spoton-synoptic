Today in Moray, you can catch some fun at Spey Bay and Lossiemouth with 1 ft @ 8s E swell and light 9 mph SW winds. Both spots are best during their respective tide windows, so get out there! Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2 ft @ 5s W with fresh 27 mph WSW winds, making it blown out and not producing. The day after, it stays flat with 1 ft @ 3s SSE, so it’s another miss. Best: today.
