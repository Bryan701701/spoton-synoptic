Today in Moray, it’s a quiet one with 3 ft @6s SSE swell, but fresh 25 mph S winds are making it messy. Tomorrow, expect a slight improvement with 2 ft @8s ENE swell and lighter 11 mph SSW winds, making spots like Spey Bay and Lossiemouth more workable. The day after, conditions drop again to 2 ft @5s W with fresh 23 mph WSW winds, keeping it poor across the board. Best: tomorrow.
