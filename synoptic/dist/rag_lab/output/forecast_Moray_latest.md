Today in Moray, it's a quiet one with 1 ft @4s NE swell and fresh 13 mph W wind. The surf isn't producing, so it might be best to give it a miss. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 2 ft @7s NE swell and light 6 mph WSW winds, making for a fun day at spots like Banff and Fraserburgh. Day after, expect 2 ft @7s N swell but fresh 20 mph W wind will likely make it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
