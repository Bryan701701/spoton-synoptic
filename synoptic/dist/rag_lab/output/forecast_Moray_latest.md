Today in Moray, surf is on the smaller side, with 2 ft @7s E and fresh 19 mph SE winds making it quite messy. Tomorrow looks better with 2 ft @7s E and lighter 10 mph S winds, especially at Fraserburgh, which should be fun on the mid-tide push. Day after, conditions drop to 1 ft @5s E, making it a quiet day for surf. Best: tomorrow.
