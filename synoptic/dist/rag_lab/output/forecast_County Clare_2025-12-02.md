Today in County Clare, it's looking solid with 10 ft @ 13s W swell and fresh 16 mph SSW winds. Good spots like Crab Island and Doolin Point are working well, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 12 ft @ 13s W with fresh 19 mph W winds, making it poor across the board. The day after, we see a further drop to 6 ft @ 10s W, still poor with 22 mph WNW winds. Best: today.
