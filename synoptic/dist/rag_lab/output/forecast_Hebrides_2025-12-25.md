Today in the Hebrides, it's looking great with 5 ft @ 11s W swell and light 5 mph SSE winds. Spots like Europie and Barvas are firing, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 11s, still workable but less punchy, with SSW winds at 9 mph. By the day after, conditions remain similar with 3 ft @ 8s WNW swell and fresh 17 mph ENE winds, making it a bit choppy. Best: today.
