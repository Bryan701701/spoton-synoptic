Today in the Hebrides, it's looking solid with 5 ft @ 11s W swell and light 5 mph SSE winds. Best spots include Europie and Barvas, both offering clean conditions. Tomorrow sees a drop to 3 ft @ 11s W, still workable, especially at Dalbeg and Dalmore. By the day after, conditions will be OK with 3 ft @ 8s WNW swell, but expect fresh 17 mph ENE winds adding some texture. Best: today.
