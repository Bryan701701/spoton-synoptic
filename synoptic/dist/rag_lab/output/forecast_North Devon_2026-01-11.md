North Devon is looking fun today with 3 ft @6s SW swell and fresh 17 mph SSE winds. Woolacombe and Putsborough are your best bets, offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 5 ft @9s WSW but the fresh 22 mph SSW wind will make it blown out across the region. By the day after, conditions improve with 3 ft @10s W swell and lighter 8 mph S winds, making it a great day to hit the beach. Best: day after.
