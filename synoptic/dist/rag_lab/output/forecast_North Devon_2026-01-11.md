Today in North Devon, surf is on with 3 ft @6s SW at spots like Woolacombe and Putsborough, though the fresh 17 mph SSE wind adds some texture. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 5 ft @9s WSW but winds ramp up to 22 mph SSW, making it blown out across the coast. By the day after, we see a return to 3 ft @10s W with lighter 8 mph S winds, creating fun, clean waves at places like Porlock Weir and Woolacombe. Best: day after.
