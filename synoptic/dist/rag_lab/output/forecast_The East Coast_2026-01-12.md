Today on the East Coast, it's a quiet scene with 6 ft @8s SSE swell, but fresh 25 mph SSW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 2 ft @7s SE swell and light 3 mph WSW winds, offering some clean options at spots like Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay. The day after, similar 2 ft @6s ESE swell continues, but winds pick up to 9 mph SW, keeping it workable mainly at St Andrews West and Arbroath. Best: tomorrow.
