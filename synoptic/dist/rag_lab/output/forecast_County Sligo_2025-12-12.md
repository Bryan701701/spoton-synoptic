Today in County Sligo, conditions are poor with a hefty 7 ft @15s WNW swell but fresh 25 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell picks up slightly to 8 ft @14s WNW, but the fresh 17 mph S winds will still keep it messy, although Easkey Right and Strandhill may offer some fun. The day after sees a drop to 5 ft @10s WNW with 22 mph SSW winds, keeping the quality low. Best: tomorrow.
