Today in County Sligo, conditions are poor with 7 ft @15s WNW swell and fresh 25 mph S winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow, expect a slight improvement with 8 ft @14s WNW swell and 17 mph S winds; Easkey Right and Strandhill could offer some workable corners during the day. The day after, conditions drop to 5 ft @10s WNW with 22 mph SSW winds, keeping it poor across the board. Best: tomorrow.
