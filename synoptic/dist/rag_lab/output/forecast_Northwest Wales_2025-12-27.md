Today in Northwest Wales, it's looking pretty quiet with 1 ft @ 5s E swell and fresh 11 mph ENE winds. Tomorrow, the swell remains at 1 ft but picks up to 9s, still under the same fresh ENE breeze. By the day after, the swell stays at 1 ft with a longer 10s period, but the wind eases to 4 mph ENE. Best: day after.
