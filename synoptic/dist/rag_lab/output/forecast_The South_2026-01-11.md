Today on the South coast, it's a bit rough with 6 ft @7s SSW swell and fresh 23 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 5 ft @8s SSW with 19 mph SSW winds, still not ideal. By the day after, conditions improve with 3 ft @9s SSW and light 8 mph ESE winds, making it a much better surf day. Best: day after.
