Today, the South is facing poor conditions with a solid 6 ft @ 7s SSW swell but fresh 23 mph SSW winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 5 ft @ 8s SSW, with winds easing to 19 mph SSW, but still not ideal. By the day after, conditions improve significantly with a fun 3 ft @ 9s SSW swell and light 8 mph ESE winds, making it the best day to hit the water. Best: day after.
