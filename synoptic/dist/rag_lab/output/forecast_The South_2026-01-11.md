Today, the South is experiencing poor conditions with 6 ft @7s SSW swell and fresh 23 mph SSW winds—definitely blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 5 ft @8s SSW, with winds easing to 19 mph SSW, but still not ideal. By the day after, conditions improve to 3 ft @9s SSW with light 8 mph ESE winds, making it the best day for a surf session. Best: day after.
