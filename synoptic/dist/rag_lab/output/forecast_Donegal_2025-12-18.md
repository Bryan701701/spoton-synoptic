Today in Donegal, it's looking poor with a hefty swell of 17 ft @16s from the W, but fresh 16 mph SSE winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 15 ft @14s, but the winds pick up to a fresh 26 mph WSW, keeping conditions challenging. On the day after, the swell continues to decrease to 7 ft @11s, yet strong 35 mph SSE winds will still keep it messy. Best: today.
