Today on the Causeway Coast, Portballintrae is offering some fun with 1 ft @ 10s WNW and fresh 16 mph S winds. It's a bit choppy, but sheltered corners should be workable. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 1 ft @ 9s WNW and lighter 9 mph S winds, making for a better day. However, the day after looks poor with 1 ft @ 5s W and fresh SSW winds, so it’s best to hit it tomorrow. Best: tomorrow.
