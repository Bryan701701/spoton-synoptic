Today on the Causeway Coast, Portballintrae is offering some fun with 1 ft @10s WNW swell and fresh 16 mph S winds. It's a bit choppy, but sheltered corners will be workable. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 1 ft @9s WNW and lighter 9 mph S winds, making it a better day for a paddle. By the day after, the swell drops to 1 ft @5s, and conditions won't be favorable. Best: tomorrow.
