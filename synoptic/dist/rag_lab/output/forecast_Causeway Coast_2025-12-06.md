Today on the Causeway Coast, Portballintrae is showing some potential with 1 ft @10s WNW and fresh 16 mph S winds. It’s a bit choppy, but sheltered corners are working. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 1 ft @9s and lighter 9 mph S winds, making it more fun at Portballintrae. Day after, the swell drops further to 1 ft @5s with a fresh SSW breeze, so it’s looking poor. Best: tomorrow.
