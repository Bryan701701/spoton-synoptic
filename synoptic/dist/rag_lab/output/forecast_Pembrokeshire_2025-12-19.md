Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a bit of a struggle with 6 ft @9s WSW swell and fresh 19 mph WSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 5 ft @8s SW, but the fresh 27 mph S winds will keep it messy. Day after, conditions improve with 5 ft @12s WSW and lighter 11 mph SSE winds, making it the best day to hit the water. Best: day after.
