Today on the East Coast, there are clean conditions with 1 ft @ 6s ESE swell and 12 mph NW winds. St Andrews West and Arbroath are your best bets, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, expect a nice bump to 2 ft @ 7s NE with lighter 7 mph WNW winds, making for fun surf at multiple spots. Day after, conditions drop back to 1 ft @ 7s NNE and remain poor across the coast. Best: tomorrow.
