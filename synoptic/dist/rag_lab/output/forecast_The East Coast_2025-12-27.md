Today on the East Coast, we have fun, small surf at 1ft @6s ESE with a moderate 12 mph NW wind. St Andrews West and Arbroath are your best bets, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions improve with a solid 2ft @7s NE swell and light 7 mph WNW winds, making for a great day at multiple spots. The day after, expect a drop back to 1ft with similar winds, so it might be a good time to chill. Best: tomorrow.
