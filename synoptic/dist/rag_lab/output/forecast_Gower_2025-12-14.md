Today in Gower, it’s a tough call with 7 ft @ 8s WSW swell but fresh 28 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 7 ft @ 9s WSW and lighter 14 mph S winds, offering some workable conditions at spots like Llangennith Beach. Day after, the swell drops to 4 ft @ 12s WSW with light 9 mph NNW winds, creating clean and fun waves at various beaches. Best: day after.
