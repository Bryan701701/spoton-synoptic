Today in Gower, conditions are poor with 7 ft @ 8s WSW swell and fresh 28 mph SSW winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 7 ft @ 9s WSW swell and lighter 14 mph S winds, offering some workable options at spots like Llangennith Beach and Broughton Bay. By the day after, the surf cleans up nicely to 4 ft @ 12s WSW with light 9 mph NNW winds, making it a great day for a session. Best: day after.
