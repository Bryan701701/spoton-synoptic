Today, the Causeway Coast is seeing 5 ft @14s WNW swell but with fresh 21 mph SSE winds making it blown out; best to give it a miss. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 7 ft @14s WNW swell and 18 mph S winds, but still not ideal—White Park Bay and Portballintrae might be your best bets. The day after, the swell drops to 5 ft @10s WNW with lighter 13 mph S winds, offering a more manageable surf at the same spots. Best: day after.
