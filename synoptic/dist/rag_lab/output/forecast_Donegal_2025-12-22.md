Today in Donegal, it's a solid day with 6 ft @ 12s W swell and light ENE winds at 8 mph. Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are both firing, with clean conditions expected throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 11s W, but the light E winds will keep it fun at spots like Dooey Beach. By the day after, we’re back to 6 ft @ 12s WNW, with NE winds, making it a great time to hit Bloody Foreland or Glencolumbkille. Best: today.
