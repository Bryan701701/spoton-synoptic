Today on the East Coast, it's looking great with 3 ft @7s SSE at Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay, both under light 3 mph SW winds. Best windows are early and mid-day, so catch those tides! Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2 ft @7s SE with fresh 8 mph WSW winds, making it less inviting. Day after, a bit of a bounce back to 3 ft @5s S, but with stronger 17 mph SSW winds, so look for sheltered spots. Best: today.
