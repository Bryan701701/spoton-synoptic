Today in Cornwall, conditions are poor with fresh onshore winds at 27 mph creating a blown-out situation across the North, South, and West coasts. Expect 6–7 ft swells, but it’s not producing any workable surf. Tomorrow, things improve significantly with clean 8 ft @ 15s W swell and lighter winds, perfect for hitting the beaches like Crantock and Fistral. The day after holds steady with similar conditions, keeping the fun going. Best: tomorrow.
