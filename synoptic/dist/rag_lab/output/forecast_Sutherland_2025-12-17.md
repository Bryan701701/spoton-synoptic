Today in Sutherland, conditions are poor with 5 ft @8s WSW swell, but fresh 23 mph SSE winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 11 ft @14s W, however, strong 35 mph SW winds will keep it messy and challenging. On the day after, the swell drops slightly to 10 ft @12s WSW, but with 22 mph SSW winds, it remains tough. Best: day after.
