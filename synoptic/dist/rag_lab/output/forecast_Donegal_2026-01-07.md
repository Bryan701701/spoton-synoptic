Today in Donegal, Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand are both offering fun 3ft @ 8s WNW with fresh 17 mph NW winds. Expect some chop, but sheltered corners should still be workable. Tomorrow, conditions improve with a solid 6ft @ 9s WNW across several spots, including Magheroaty Beach and Bloody Foreland, with light winds. The day after, surf holds at 4ft @ 10s with a bit more wind, but still plenty of options. Best: tomorrow.
