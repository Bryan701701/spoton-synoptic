Today in South Devon, conditions are poor with 3 ft @6s ESE swell and fresh 31 mph E wind, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 2 ft @5s ESE with lighter 12 mph NE winds, but still not producing much. The day after, the swell picks back up to 3 ft @5s E, but remains messy with 13 mph ENE winds. Best: tomorrow.
