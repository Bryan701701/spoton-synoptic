Today in the Hebrides, surf is looking solid with 3 ft @ 11s W and a light 10 mph SW wind. Great options at Europie and Barvas, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions ease slightly with 3 ft @ 10s W and a fresh 14 mph ENE wind, still workable at spots like Dalbeg and Dalmore. Day after, we see a drop to 3 ft @ 9s NW with light 5 mph ESE winds, making it a fun day at Tolsta and Port of Ness. Best: today.
