The East Coast is looking fun today with 2 ft @5s SSE swell and light SSW winds at 11 mph. Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay are both clean and working well, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with fresh S winds at 23 mph, making it blown out across the coast. Day after, the swell returns to 2 ft @6s SE with light S winds, bringing back some good options at spots like Coldinham Bay and St Andrews East. Best: today.
