Today is quiet across the North East with 1 ft @4s S swell and fresh 18 mph SSW winds, making for blown-out conditions. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 3 ft @5s ESE, but the 19 mph SE wind will still keep things choppy. Day after brings 4 ft @6s E swell with 12 mph ESE winds, offering some workable conditions at spots like Saltburn Beach and South Shields during the tide windows. Best: day after.
