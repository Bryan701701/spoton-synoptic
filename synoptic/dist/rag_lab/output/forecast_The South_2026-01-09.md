Today, the South is looking good with 2 ft @ 9s SW swell and light 10 mph WNW winds. Spots like Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane are clean and fun, especially on the push from 08:45 to 16:50. Tomorrow, conditions drop as the swell remains but the period shortens to 7s, making it less appealing with 16 mph NW winds. By the day after, we see a slight improvement with 4 ft @ 6s S swell, but winds remain fresh and onshore, making it a mixed bag. Best: today.
