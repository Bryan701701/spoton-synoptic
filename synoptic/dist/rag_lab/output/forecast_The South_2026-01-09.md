Today, the South is lighting up with clean 2 ft @9s SW swell and light 10 mph WNW winds. Spots like Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane are working well, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2 ft @7s WSW with fresh 16 mph NW winds, making it a poor day for surf. Day after, swell picks up to 4 ft @6s S, but the wind stays fresh at 16 mph, keeping it choppy. Best: today.
