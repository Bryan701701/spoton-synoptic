Today is a bit quiet across the North East with 2 ft @6s NNW lines and fresh 13 mph WNW wind. Tomorrow, we see a nice bump to 3 ft @8s NE with light 5 mph W winds, making for some clean conditions. Day after, the swell builds further to 4 ft @6s ENE, still with light 8 mph NW winds, keeping it fun. Best: tomorrow.
