Today in County Sligo, surf is small and poor with 2 ft @9s N and fresh 6 mph ENE wind; not producing. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 2 ft @11s N and light 1 mph SE winds at Dunmoran Strand and Lackan Bay, offering some workable corners. Day after, conditions pick up significantly with 6 ft @8s NNW and light 6 mph WSW winds, making for a fun day at spots like Easkey and Lackan Bay. Best: day after.
