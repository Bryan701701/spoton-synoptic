Today in North Devon, it's looking solid with 4 ft @ 12s W swell and light 9 mph S winds. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are prime spots, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 5 ft @ 9s W swell and fresh 24 mph NW winds, making it poor across the board. On the day after, we bounce back to 4 ft @ 11s W with 12 mph ESE winds, offering good options at Porlock Weir and Woolacombe. Best: today.
