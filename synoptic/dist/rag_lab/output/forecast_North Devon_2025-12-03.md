North Devon is lighting up today with clean 4 ft @ 12s W swell and light 9 mph S winds. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are great picks, with optimal tides for both. Tomorrow, conditions drop as the swell weakens to 5 ft @ 9s W, but fresh 24 mph NW winds will make it blown out across the board. Day after brings back the fun with 4 ft @ 11s W, and ESE winds at 12 mph, making for a solid surf day. Best: today.
