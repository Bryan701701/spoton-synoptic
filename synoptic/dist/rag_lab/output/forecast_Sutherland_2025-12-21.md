Sutherland is lighting up today with solid 5 ft @ 16s WNW swell and fresh 17 mph ESE winds. Sheltered corners like Melvich and Strathy are working well, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @ 12s but remains manageable; expect a bit more wind at 20 mph ESE, making it less favorable. By the day after, conditions ease with 2 ft @ 11s and lighter 9 mph SE winds, offering a fun session at spots like Melvich and Sango Bay. Best: today.
