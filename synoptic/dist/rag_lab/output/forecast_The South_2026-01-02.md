Today is quiet across The South with 1 ft @5s SW swell and fresh 15 mph WNW wind. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 1 ft @7s SSW swell and moderate N winds, making sheltered spots like Derrynane and Barley Cove workable. The day after continues the trend with 1 ft @9s SSW swell and light WNW winds, still best in those same corners. Best: tomorrow.
