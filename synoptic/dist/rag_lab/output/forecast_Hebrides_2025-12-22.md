Today in the Hebrides, surf is looking solid at 5 ft @12s W with fresh 17 mph ESE winds. Good spots like Europie and Barvas are working well, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @9s WSW with moderate 11 mph S winds, still providing some fun waves at spots like Dalbeg and Scarasta. Day after, we see a nice bump back up to 6 ft @12s W with light 6 mph ENE winds, making it a great day to hit the water at any of the local breaks. Best: day after.
