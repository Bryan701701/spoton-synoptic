Today in the Hebrides, surf is looking solid with 5 ft @12s W swell and fresh 17 mph ESE winds. Good spots like Europie and Barvas are working well, especially during their prime tides. Tomorrow, we drop to 3 ft @9s WSW with lighter 11 mph S winds, still offering fun conditions at spots like Dalbeg. Day after, swell picks up again to 6 ft @12s W with light 6 mph ENE winds, making it a great day for all levels at places like Scarasta. Best: day after.
