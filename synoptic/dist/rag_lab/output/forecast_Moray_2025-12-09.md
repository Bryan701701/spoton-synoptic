Today in Moray, we have some small but workable surf at Spey Bay and Lossiemouth, both around 1ft @5s with a fresh 16 mph SE wind. Best times to hit these spots are during the mid-tide push. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3ft @5s with a stronger 21 mph SW wind, making it blown out and poor across the region. The day after continues the trend with similar poor conditions at 1ft @5s and light winds. Best: today.
