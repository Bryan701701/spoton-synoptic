Today in Moray, you’ll find small but workable waves at Spey Bay and Lossiemouth, both around 1ft @5s with fresh 16 mph SE winds. Best times are during the mid-tide push, so aim for 08:43–15:26. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3ft @5s but with stronger 21 mph SW winds, making it blown out. Day after, still poor with 1ft @5s and 11 mph SSW winds. Best: today.
