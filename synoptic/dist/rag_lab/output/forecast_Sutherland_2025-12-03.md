Sutherland is lighting up today with 3 ft @ 9s WNW swell and fresh 18 mph SSE winds. Melvich and Strathy are both working well, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell remains steady at 3 ft @ 9s, but the wind picks up to 21 mph SE, making conditions less favorable, especially for Balnakeil and Oldshoremore. By the day after, the swell jumps to 7 ft @ 14s with more manageable 16 mph SE winds, bringing in some solid surf at spots like Melvich and Sango Bay. Best: day after.
