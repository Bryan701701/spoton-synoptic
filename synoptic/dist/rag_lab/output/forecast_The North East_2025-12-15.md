Today at Saltburn Beach, expect fun 2 ft @6s SE with a moderate 12 mph SSW wind. It’s clean and workable, especially during the tide window from 08:20 to 15:37. Tomorrow drops to 1 ft @6s SE, still with a light W wind, but it’ll be a bit quieter. The day after, conditions worsen with 1 ft @3s SSE and fresh 20 mph S winds, making it less inviting. Best: today.
