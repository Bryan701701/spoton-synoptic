Today in Gower, conditions are poor with 5 ft @8s W swell, but fresh 27 mph NW winds are blowing it out. Tomorrow looks much better, with 4 ft @10s WSW swell and light 9 mph NNE winds, making it clean and fun at spots like Llangennith Beach. Day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @7s SW with fresh 22 mph SE winds, keeping it messy and uninviting. Best: tomorrow.
