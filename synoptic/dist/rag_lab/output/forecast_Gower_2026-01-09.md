Today in Gower, it's a bit rough with fresh NW winds at 27 mph and 5 ft @ 8s W swell. All spots are blown out, so it’s best to give it a miss. Tomorrow brings a nice change with 4 ft @ 10s WSW swell and light NNE winds at 9 mph; expect clean conditions at spots like Llangennith Beach. The day after, conditions drop to 3 ft @ 7s SW with fresh SE winds, making it less appealing. Best: tomorrow.
