Today on the West Coast, it's a bit rough with 4 ft @7s SE swell and fresh 39 mph ESE winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with 8 ft @10s W swell and 29 mph SW winds, still not producing anything worthwhile. The day after continues the trend with 6 ft @11s W swell and similar winds, keeping it poor across the board. Best: none.
