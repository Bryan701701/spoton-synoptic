Sutherland is lighting up today with 5 ft @11s W swell and a moderate 12 mph SSW wind. Melvich and Strathy are great picks, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, expect a slight drop to 4 ft @11s, but still fun with similar wind conditions. Day after, it fades further to 3 ft @7s, and the wind shifts SE, making it less favorable. Best: today.
