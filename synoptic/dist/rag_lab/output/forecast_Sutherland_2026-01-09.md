Sutherland is lighting up today with solid 5 ft @11s W swell and light SSW winds at 12 mph. Melvich and Strathy are your best bets, with Melvich peaking from 10:50 to 12:40. Tomorrow, expect a slight drop to 4 ft @11s W with moderate SSE winds at 16 mph, still offering fun conditions at the same spots. Day after, conditions fade to 3 ft @7s WSW with SE winds, making it less appealing. Best: today.
