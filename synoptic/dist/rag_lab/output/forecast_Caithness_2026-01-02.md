Today in Caithness, it's looking poor with 4 ft @7s NNE swell and fresh 21 mph NNE winds. Tomorrow, the swell increases to 5 ft @6s but the wind picks up to a strong 30 mph NNE, making it quite choppy. Day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @6s with winds still fresh at 32 mph NNW, keeping conditions messy. Best: today.
