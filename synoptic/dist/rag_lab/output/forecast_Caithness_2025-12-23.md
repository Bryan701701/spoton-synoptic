Today in Caithness, it's a quiet scene with no surf action—flat and wind on it. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 3 ft @7s ESE and light SSW winds, making for some fun options at spots like Sinclair's Bay and Sandside Bay. The day after, expect a solid 4 ft @11s WNW with light SSE winds, perfect for catching some clean waves at Point of Ness and Dunnet Bay. Best: day after.
