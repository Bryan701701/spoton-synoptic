Today, North is looking solid with 9 ft @ 17s W and S winds at 14 mph; Fistral and Town are your best bets, especially around mid-tide. South offers fun 5 ft @ 11s SW at Porthcurno and Praa Sands, both clean with light SSW winds. Over on the West, Sennen Cove and Gwenvor are also good options with 9 ft @ 14s W and light SW winds. Tomorrow, expect a drop in quality across all coasts with fresh winds making it blown out. Best: today.
