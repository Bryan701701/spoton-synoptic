Today in Sutherland, it's looking good with 3 ft @10s N swell and a moderate 16 mph SE wind. Melvich and Strathy are both working well, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, expect similar 3 ft @14s NW swell, but the fresh 20 mph ESE wind will make conditions challenging, with Balnakeil and Sandwood Bay being the best bets. Day after, conditions drop to 2 ft @7s ENE with strong 38 mph ESE winds, making it a tough day for surfing. Best: today.
