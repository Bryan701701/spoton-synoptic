North Devon is lighting up today with 4 ft @ 8s W swell and moderate 11 mph SSW winds. Great options at Porlock Weir and Lynmouth, with clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, expect similar 4 ft @ 12s W swell, but with lighter 9 mph ESE winds, making it even more inviting. Day after, winds pick up to 17 mph WSW, creating a bit of chop, but still 4 ft @ 9s W swell across the spots. Best: tomorrow.
