North Devon is looking solid today with clean 4 ft @8s W swell and light SSW winds at 11 mph. Best spots include Porlock Weir and Lynmouth, both offering fun waves throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 4 ft but shifts to a longer period of 12s with ESE winds at 9 mph, making it a great day for all the local breaks. On the day after, expect similar conditions but with fresh WSW winds at 17 mph, which may chop things up a bit. Best: tomorrow.
