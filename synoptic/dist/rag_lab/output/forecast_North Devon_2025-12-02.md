North Devon is looking solid today with 4 ft @ 8s W swell and light SSW winds at 11 mph. Good spots like Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are working well, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 4 ft but shifts to a longer 12s period with light ESE winds, making it another great day for the beaches. Day after, conditions drop slightly to 4 ft @ 9s with fresh WSW winds, so expect some chop. Best: tomorrow.
