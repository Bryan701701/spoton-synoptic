Today in North Devon, it's a solid 4 ft @ 8s W with light SSW winds at 11 mph, making for clean conditions. Good spots like Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are on the list, with optimal tides for both. Tomorrow, expect similar swell at 4 ft but with a longer period of 12s and lighter ESE winds at 9 mph, keeping it tidy across the beaches. Day after, conditions shift slightly with 4 ft @ 9s W and fresh WSW winds at 17 mph, making it a bit choppy. Best: tomorrow.
