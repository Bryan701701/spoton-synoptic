Today in Donegal, conditions are poor with a hefty 11 ft @10s W swell, but fresh 30 mph WSW winds are blowing it out. Tomorrow sees a similar situation with 8 ft @10s WSW swell and stronger 41 mph S winds, keeping it messy. On the day after, the swell picks up to 12 ft @14s W, but with 19 mph SSE winds, it remains challenging. Best: day after.
