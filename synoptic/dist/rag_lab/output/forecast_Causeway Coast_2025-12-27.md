Today on the Causeway Coast, it's a bit of a struggle with 2 ft @7s NNE swell and fresh 17 mph E winds making for blown out conditions. Tomorrow looks much better with 2 ft @8s NNW swell and light 6 mph E winds, offering clean options at spots like White Park Bay and Portballintrae during the mid-day push. The day after, expect similar 2 ft @10s NW swell, but only Portballintrae stands out as a good pick. Best: tomorrow.
