Today in Gower, it's a solid day with 5 ft @12s WSW swell and light ESE winds at 9 mph. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are looking particularly good, with optimal tides for both spots. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @10s WSW with fresh E winds at 19 mph, making it poor across the board. By the day after, the swell further decreases to 2 ft @7s SW, still with E winds at 16 mph, but some spots like Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach may still offer a bit of fun. Best: today.
