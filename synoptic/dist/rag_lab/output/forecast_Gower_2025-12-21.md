Today in Gower, it’s a solid day with 5 ft @12s WSW swell and light ESE winds at 9 mph. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are both firing, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @10s WSW with fresh E winds at 19 mph, making it poor across the board. On the day after, expect 2 ft @7s SW with similar E winds; still workable at spots like Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach. Best: today.
