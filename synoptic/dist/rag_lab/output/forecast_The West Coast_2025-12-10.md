Today on the West Coast, it's a no-go with 9 ft @10s W swell and fresh 34 mph SW winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow, conditions remain poor with 6 ft @11s W swell and 35 mph SSW winds, still not producing anything worthwhile. Day after, the swell drops to 5 ft @14s WNW but with 24 mph S winds, it won't be much better. Best: none.
