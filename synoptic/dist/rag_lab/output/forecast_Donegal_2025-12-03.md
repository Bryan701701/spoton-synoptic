Today in Donegal, it's looking solid with 7 ft @ 12s W swell and light S winds at 11 mph. Great spots like Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand are working well, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 5 ft @ 10s W with fresh WSW winds at 16 mph, but spots like Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty will still have some fun waves. By the day after, conditions worsen with 10 ft @ 13s W swell but fresh SSE winds at 22 mph will make it blown out. Best: today.
