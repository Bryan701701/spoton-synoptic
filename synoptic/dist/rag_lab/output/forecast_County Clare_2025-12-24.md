County Clare is lighting up today with solid 4 ft @ 12s WNW swell and light 8 mph ENE winds. Doolin Point and Lahinch Beach are prime spots, offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 1 ft @ 10s, making it a quiet day with no real surf to chase. The day after sees a slight bump to 2 ft @ 9s, but still not much to write home about. Best: today.
