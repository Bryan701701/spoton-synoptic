Today in County Clare, it's looking great with 4 ft @ 12s WNW swell and light 8 mph ENE winds. Doolin Point and Lahinch Beach are prime spots, offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 1 ft @ 10s WNW, making it a quiet day with no real surf action. The day after, we see a slight increase to 2 ft @ 9s WNW, but still not much to write home about. Best: today.
