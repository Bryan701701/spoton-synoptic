Today in South Devon, it's a bit of a struggle with 3 ft @6s SE swell and fresh 18 mph ESE winds making it messy. Tomorrow, similar conditions persist with 3 ft @6s E swell and 14 mph ENE winds, keeping it on the poor side. By the day after, the swell picks up to 4 ft @6s E, but strong 32 mph ENE winds will likely blow it out. Best: today.
