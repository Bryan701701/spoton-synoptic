Today in South Devon, conditions are not producing much with 3 ft @6s SE swell and fresh 18 mph ESE winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow sees similar conditions with 3 ft @6s E swell and slightly lighter 14 mph ENE winds, still not ideal. By the day after, the swell picks up to 4 ft @6s E, but fresh 32 mph ENE winds will keep it messy. Best: tomorrow.
