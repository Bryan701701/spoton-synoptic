Today on Gower, it's a bit of a bummer with 6 ft @8s WSW swell and fresh 24 mph SW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the conditions improve significantly with 6 ft @10s WSW swell and light 3 mph S winds, offering clean surf at spots like Llangennith Beach. The day after, swell drops to 4 ft @9s W with moderate 9 mph NW winds, still providing fun waves at various locations. Best: tomorrow.
