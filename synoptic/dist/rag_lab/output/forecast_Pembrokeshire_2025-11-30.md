Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a bit of a bummer with 4 ft @ 8s W swell, but fresh 7 mph WNW wind is making it poor across the board. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 8 ft @ 8s SW, but fresh 29 mph SW winds will have it blown out—definitely not the day to hit the water. On the bright side, the day after brings a solid 7 ft @ 9s WSW with light 9 mph WSW winds, making for cleaner conditions at spots like Whitesands Bay. Best: day after.
