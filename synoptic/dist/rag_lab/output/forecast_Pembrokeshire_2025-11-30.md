Today in Pembrokeshire, surf is 4 ft @ 8s W with a fresh 7 mph WNW wind, but it's not producing well—give it a miss. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with 8 ft @ 8s SW and a strong 29 mph SW wind, leading to blown-out surf across the board. Day after, the swell drops to 7 ft @ 9s WSW with a lighter 9 mph WSW wind, creating a much better scene for surfing. Best: day after.
