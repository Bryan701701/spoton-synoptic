Today on Gower, it's a bit rough with 6 ft @8s SW swell and fresh 19 mph S winds making it blown out—best to give it a miss. Tomorrow, conditions improve significantly with 4 ft @12s WSW swell and light 6 mph N winds, making for clean and fun surf at spots like Llangennith Beach. The day after, expect 5 ft @9s WSW swell but with fresh 20 mph S winds, leading to messy conditions again. Best: tomorrow.
