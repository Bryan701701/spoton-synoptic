Today, the South is lighting up with clean 4 ft @ 8s SSW swell and light 9 mph SW winds. Great spots like Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane are prime for action, especially from 09:27 to 17:32. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 8s with fresh 14 mph W winds, making it a bit choppy but still surfable at sheltered corners. By the day after, conditions worsen with 4 ft @ 8s SW swell but strong 19 mph W winds, leading to blown-out surf. Best: today.
