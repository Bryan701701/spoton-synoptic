Today, the South is lighting up with solid 4 ft @ 8s SSW swell and a light 9 mph SW wind. Great conditions at spots like Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane, especially from 09:27 to 17:32. Tomorrow, we see a slight drop to 3 ft @ 8s with a fresh 14 mph W wind, making it a bit choppy but still workable at sheltered corners. By the day after, conditions worsen with 4 ft @ 8s SW swell but fresh 19 mph W wind, leading to blown-out surf. Best: today.
