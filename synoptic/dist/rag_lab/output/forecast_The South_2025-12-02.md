Today in The South, it's looking great with clean 4 ft @8s SSW swell and light 9 mph SW winds. Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane are prime spots, especially between 09:27 and 17:32. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @8s with fresh 14 mph W winds, making it a bit choppy but still surfable. By the day after, conditions worsen with 4 ft @8s SW swell but strong 19 mph W winds, leading to blown-out surf. Best: today.
