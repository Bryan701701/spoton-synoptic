The South is looking great today with clean 4 ft @8s SSW swell and light 9 mph SW winds. Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane are prime spots, both offering solid conditions from 09:27 to 17:32. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @8s with fresh 14 mph W winds, making it a bit choppy but still surfable at sheltered corners. By the day after, conditions worsen with 4 ft @8s SW swell but stronger 19 mph W winds, likely making it blown out. Best: today.
