The South is lighting up today with clean 4ft @8s SSW swell and light 9 mph SW winds. Spots like Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane are prime from 09:27 to 17:32. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3ft @8s with fresh 14 mph W winds, making it a bit choppy but still workable. By the day after, conditions worsen with 4ft @8s SW swell but fresh 19 mph W winds, leading to blown-out surf. Best: today.
