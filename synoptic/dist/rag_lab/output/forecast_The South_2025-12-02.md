Today, the South is lighting up with clean 4 ft @8s SSW swell and light 9 mph SW winds. Great spots include Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane, both working well from 09:27 to 17:32. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @8s with fresh 14 mph W winds, still offering some fun at the same locations. Day after, it’s a bit rough with 4 ft @8s SW swell and fresh 19 mph W winds, making it less appealing. Best: today.
