Today in Pembrokeshire, it’s a solid day with 6 ft @12s WSW swell and light 7 mph SSW winds. Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are both firing, offering clean conditions during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions take a turn for the worse with fresh 29 mph SSW winds and 7 ft @8s SW swell, making it poor across the board. Day after, the swell drops to 5 ft @9s SW with 24 mph S winds, still not ideal. Best: today.
