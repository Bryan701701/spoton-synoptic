Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a solid day with 6 ft @12s WSW swell and light 7 mph SSW winds. Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are both firing, with great conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, expect a shift as the swell rises to 7 ft @8s SW but fresh 29 mph SSW winds will make it blown out. The day after, conditions remain poor with 5 ft @9s SW and 24 mph S winds. Best: today.
