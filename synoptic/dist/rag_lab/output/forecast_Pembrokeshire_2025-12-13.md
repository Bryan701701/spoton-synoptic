Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a solid 6 ft @ 12s WSW with light 7 mph SSW winds, making for clean conditions at spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay. Tomorrow, expect a shift as the swell rises to 7 ft @ 8s SW but with fresh 29 mph SSW winds, leading to blown-out surf across the region. Day after, the swell drops to 5 ft @ 9s SW with 24 mph S winds, keeping conditions poor. Best: today.
