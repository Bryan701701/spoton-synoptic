Today in the Hebrides, it's a no-go with 10 ft @9s SW swell and fresh 40 mph SW winds—definitely blown out. Tomorrow looks much better as the swell drops to 8 ft @11s NW with light 9 mph WSW winds, making for clean conditions at spots like Tolsta and Dalmore. Day after, the swell continues to drop to 7 ft @9s NW, but the wind picks up to 20 mph, keeping it poor across the board. Best: tomorrow.
