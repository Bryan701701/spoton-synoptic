Today in the Hebrides, conditions are poor with 10 ft @9s SW swell and fresh 40 mph SW winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 8 ft @11s NW with much lighter 9 mph WSW winds, offering some clean options at spots like Tolsta and Dalmore during the mid-tide push. The day after, the swell continues to drop to 7 ft @9s NW, but with 20 mph W winds, conditions remain poor. Best: tomorrow.
