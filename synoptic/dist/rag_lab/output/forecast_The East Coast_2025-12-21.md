The East Coast is lighting up today with 3 ft @5s SE swell and fresh 15 mph SE winds. Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay are your best bets, especially during the mid-morning push. Tomorrow, conditions drop to poor with 3 ft @5s ESE swell and 19 mph ESE winds—best to give it a miss. Day after, things improve with 4 ft @7s ESE and light 7 mph SSE winds, making for a fun surf day at spots like Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay. Best: day after.
