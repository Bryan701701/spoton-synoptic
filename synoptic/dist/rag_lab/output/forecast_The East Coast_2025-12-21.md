The East Coast is looking fun today with 3 ft @5s SE swell and a fresh 15 mph SE wind. Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay are your best bets, especially during the mid-morning push. Tomorrow, conditions drop to poor with similar swell but a stronger 19 mph ESE wind, making it less inviting. Day after sees a nice improvement with 4 ft @7s ESE swell and light 7 mph SSE winds, perfect for a surf session. Best: day after.
