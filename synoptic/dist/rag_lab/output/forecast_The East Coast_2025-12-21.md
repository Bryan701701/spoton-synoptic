Today on the East Coast, we've got 3 ft @ 5s SE swell with a fresh 15 mph SE wind. Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay are your best bets, with sheltered corners working nicely. Tomorrow, conditions drop to poor with the same swell but stronger 19 mph ESE winds, making it less inviting. Day after, expect a solid improvement with 4 ft @ 7s ESE and light 7 mph SSE winds, offering fun surf at multiple spots. Best: day after.
