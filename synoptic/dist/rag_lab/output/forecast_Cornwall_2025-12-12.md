Today in Cornwall, North is firing with clean 8 ft @ 14s W swell and light 8 mph NW winds. Crantock and Fistral are prime spots, especially early on the push. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 7 ft @ 14s W, but still fun with SSW winds. The day after, conditions ease further with 6 ft @ 10s W, but winds pick up, making it a bit choppy. Best: today.
