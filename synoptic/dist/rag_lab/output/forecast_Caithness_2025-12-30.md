Today in Caithness, we’ve got some fun options with 2ft @8s NE swell and N winds at 13 mph. Check out Ackergill and Sinclair's Bay for some clean lines, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 3ft @5s WNW swell and fresh onshore winds at 21 mph, making it a bit messy. By the day after, expect 6ft @6s NW swell with strong winds at 36 mph, leading to blown-out conditions. Best: today.
