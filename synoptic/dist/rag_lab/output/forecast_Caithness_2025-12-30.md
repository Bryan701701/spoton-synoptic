Today in Caithness, surf is looking fun with 2ft @8s NE swell and light N winds at 13 mph. Good spots like Ackergill and Sinclair's Bay are working well, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3ft @5s WNW with fresh 21 mph WNW winds, making it less favorable. By the day after, expect 6ft @6s NW with strong 36 mph NNW winds, likely blown out. Best: today.
