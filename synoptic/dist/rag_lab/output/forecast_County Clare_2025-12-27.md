Today in County Clare, it's a quiet scene with 1 ft @9s WNW swell and fresh 14 mph ENE winds, making for blown-out conditions. Tomorrow, the swell remains at 1 ft but shifts to 11s, with lighter 5 mph NE winds, still not producing much. By the day after, things pick up to 2 ft @13s, with clean conditions at spots like Lahinch Beach and Cregg Beach, making it the best day to get out there. Best: day after.
