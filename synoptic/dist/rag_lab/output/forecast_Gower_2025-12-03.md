Today, Gower is lighting up with solid 5 ft @ 11s WSW swell and a moderate 11 mph SW wind. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are your best bets, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, expect a slight increase to 6 ft @ 8s WSW with fresh 15 mph WNW winds, making for choppy conditions but still some fun waves. The day after, the swell drops back to 5 ft @ 10s WSW with 17 mph S winds, keeping it workable at sheltered spots like Pete's Reef. Best: today.
