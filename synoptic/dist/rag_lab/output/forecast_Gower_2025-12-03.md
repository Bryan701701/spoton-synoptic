Today in Gower, it's looking great with a solid 5 ft @ 11s WSW swell and light 11 mph SW winds. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are the top picks, both offering fun conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell increases slightly to 6 ft @ 8s WSW, but winds pick up to 15 mph WNW, making it a bit choppy. The day after, expect similar 5 ft @ 10s WSW surf with 17 mph S winds, still workable at sheltered spots. Best: today.
