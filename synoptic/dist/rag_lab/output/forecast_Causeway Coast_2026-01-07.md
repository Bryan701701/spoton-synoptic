Today, the Causeway Coast is seeing some hefty 8 ft @ 8s NNW swell, but with fresh 24 mph NNW winds, it's blown out across the board. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 3 ft @ 9s WNW swell and 16 mph WNW winds, making White Park Bay and Portballintrae the best bets. The day after, the swell picks up to 4 ft @ 10s WNW, still with 16 mph WNW winds, keeping the same spots in play. Best: tomorrow.
