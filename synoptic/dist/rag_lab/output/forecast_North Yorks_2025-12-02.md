North Yorks is looking fun today with 2 ft @8s NE swell and fresh 16 mph SW winds. Withernsea, Filey, and Whitby Beach are all working well, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, expect similar conditions with 2 ft @7s E swell and lighter 13 mph S winds, still offering some playful surf. Day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @5s SE with fresh 18 mph S winds, but still some options at the usual spots. Best: today.
