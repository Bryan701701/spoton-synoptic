North Yorks is looking fun today with 2 ft @8s NE swell and fresh 16 mph SW winds. Withernsea, Filey, and Whitby Beach are all working well—ideal for a mellow session. Tomorrow, expect similar conditions with 2 ft @7s E swell and moderate 13 mph S winds, still offering some rideable waves. Day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @5s SE with fresh 18 mph S winds, making it less appealing. Best: today.
