Today in North Yorks, we've got clean 2 ft @8s NE lines with a fresh 16 mph SW wind. Withernsea, Filey, and Whitby Beach are all working well, especially during their peak tide windows. Tomorrow, expect similar conditions with 2 ft @7s E and a lighter 13 mph S wind, still offering some fun options. Day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @5s SE with a fresh 18 mph S wind, making it a bit choppy. Best: today.
