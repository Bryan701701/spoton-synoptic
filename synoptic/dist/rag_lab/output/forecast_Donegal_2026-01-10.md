Today in Donegal, it's looking great with 6 ft @ 11s W swell and a light 12 mph SW wind. Spots like Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand are clean and working well, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 5 ft @ 8s SW with fresh 24 mph S winds, making it poor across the board. By the day after, the swell picks up to 10 ft @ 10s WSW, but the strong SSW wind will keep it messy. Best: today.
