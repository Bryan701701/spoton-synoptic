Today in Moray, it’s a bit rough with 7 ft @8s N swell and fresh 28 mph NNW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 6 ft @7s N swell and lighter 15 mph NNW winds, offering some workable conditions at spots like Fraserburgh and West Point. Day after, conditions drop again to 6 ft @8s N with fresh 30 mph NNW winds, keeping it messy. Best: tomorrow.
