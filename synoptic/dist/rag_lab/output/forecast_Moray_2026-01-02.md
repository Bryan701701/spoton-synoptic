Today in Moray, conditions are poor with a fresh 28 mph NNW wind on 7 ft @ 8s N swell. It's blown out, so best to give it a miss. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 6 ft @ 7s N swell and lighter 15 mph NNW winds, making it workable at spots like Fraserburgh and West Point during the mid-tide push. The day after, conditions drop again with fresh 30 mph NNW winds on 6 ft @ 8s N swell, leading to another blown-out day. Best: tomorrow.
