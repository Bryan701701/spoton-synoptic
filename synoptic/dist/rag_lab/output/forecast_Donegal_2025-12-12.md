Today in Donegal, it's a bit of a bummer with the swell not hitting right—13 ft @ 15s W but fresh 20 mph SSE winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 12 ft @ 14s, but the wind picks up to 25 mph from the south, keeping it messy. On the day after, the swell continues to decrease to 9 ft @ 11s, with winds easing slightly to 18 mph, but still not ideal. Best: day after.
