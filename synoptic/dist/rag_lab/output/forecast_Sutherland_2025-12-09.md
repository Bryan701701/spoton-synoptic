Today in Sutherland, conditions are poor with 4 ft @12s W swell but fresh 15 mph ESE winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow, the swell ramps up to 9 ft @8s SW, but with strong 43 mph SW winds, it's not looking safe or fun. The day after, the swell drops slightly to 8 ft @9s W with 32 mph SSW winds, still too rough for most surfers. Best: none.
