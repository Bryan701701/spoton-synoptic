Today in Pembrokeshire, surf is looking fun at 5 ft @ 8s WSW with a moderate 12 mph WNW wind. Good spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are working well, especially during their prime tides. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 4 ft @ 10s WSW and light 6 mph SSW winds, making it a great day for a session. Day after, expect 9 ft @ 11s WSW but with fresh 27 mph SW winds, likely blowing it out. Best: tomorrow.
