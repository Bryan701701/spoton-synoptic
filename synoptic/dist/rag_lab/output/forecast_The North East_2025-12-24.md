Today, the North East is lighting up with 4 ft @ 7s E swell and fresh 17 mph ESE winds. Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach are prime spots, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @ 5s E with fresh 20 mph E winds, making it a poor day for surf. By the day after, we see a slight improvement with 2 ft @ 5s E, but still not ideal. Best: today.
