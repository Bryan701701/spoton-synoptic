Today, Portballintrae is lighting up with 2 ft @11s NW and light NNE winds at 8 mph, making for a clean session. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2 ft @7s NNE with fresh E winds at 14 mph, so it’s best to give it a miss. The day after, Portballintrae holds 1 ft @8s NW with stronger W winds at 17 mph, still not ideal. Best: today.
