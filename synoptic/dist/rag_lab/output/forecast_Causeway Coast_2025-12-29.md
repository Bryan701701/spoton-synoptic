Today on the Causeway Coast, Portballintrae is the standout with a clean 2 ft @ 11s NW and light 8 mph NNE winds. It’s a great day to catch some fun waves between 08:53 and 16:03. Tomorrow, conditions drop with a similar 2 ft @ 7s NNE but with fresh 14 mph E winds making it less inviting. The day after, Portballintrae sees a further decline to 1 ft @ 8s NW and 17 mph W winds, so it’s looking pretty poor overall. Best: today.
