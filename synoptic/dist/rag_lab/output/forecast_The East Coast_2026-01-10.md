Today on the East Coast, it's looking good with 5 ft @ 8s E swell and a moderate 16 mph S wind. Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay are your best bets, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 5 ft @ 6s SE swell and fresh 28 mph S winds, making it poor across the board. The day after, similar poor conditions persist with 6 ft @ 8s SSE swell and strong winds. Best: today.
