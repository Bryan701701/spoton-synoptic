The East Coast is looking good today with 5 ft @8s E swell and a moderate 16 mph S wind. Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay are the top picks, especially during the tide windows from 08:34–11:17 and 12:47–15:58. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 5 ft @6s SE swell and fresh 28 mph S winds, making it poor for surfing. The day after continues the trend with similar poor conditions. Best: today.
