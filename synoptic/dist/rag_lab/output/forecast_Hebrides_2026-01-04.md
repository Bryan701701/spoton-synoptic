Today in the Hebrides, it's a bit rough with 8 ft @9s N swell and fresh 29 mph NNW winds making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 6 ft @9s N with 27 mph N winds, still not ideal. Day after brings a cleaner 5 ft @7s NW with lighter 16 mph NW winds, making it more workable at spots like Tolsta and Europie. Best: day after.
