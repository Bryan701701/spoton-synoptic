Today in North Devon, it's a no-go with 8 ft @11s W swell and fresh 29 mph WSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a shift with 4 ft @12s W swell and lighter 14 mph SW winds, offering some workable options at spots like Woolacombe and Croyde Beach. Day after, conditions drop again to 4 ft @8s WSW, but winds pick up to 21 mph SSW, keeping it poor across the board. Best: tomorrow.
