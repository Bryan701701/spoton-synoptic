Today in North Devon, it's a tough call with 8 ft @11s W swell and fresh 29 mph WSW winds making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 4 ft @12s W swell and moderate 14 mph SW winds, offering some workable options at spots like Woolacombe and Croyde. Day after, the swell drops to 4 ft @8s WSW with fresh 21 mph SSW winds, keeping it poor again. Best: tomorrow.
