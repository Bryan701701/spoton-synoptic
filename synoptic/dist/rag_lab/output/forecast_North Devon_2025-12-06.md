Today in North Devon, it's a bit rough with 8 ft @11s W swell and fresh 29 mph WSW winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, conditions improve to 4 ft @12s W with lighter 14 mph SW winds, offering some workable surf at spots like Woolacombe and Croyde. Day after, it drops to 4 ft @8s WSW, but the fresh 21 mph SSW wind will keep it messy. Best: tomorrow.
