Today in Caithness, it’s a quiet scene with no surf action—flat conditions and no swell hitting the coast. Tomorrow brings a nice change with 4 ft @ 8s E swell and light WNW winds, making for clean and fun waves at spots like Sinclair's Bay and Ackergill. The day after, conditions drop to 2 ft @ 6s E with a fresh S wind, so it may be a bit choppy. Best: tomorrow.
