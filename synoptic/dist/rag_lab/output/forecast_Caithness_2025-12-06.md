Today in Caithness, it's a quiet scene with no surf action—flat and wind on it. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 4 ft @ 8s E swell and light WNW winds, making for some clean options at spots like Sinclair's Bay and Ackergill. The day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 6s E, still workable but not as punchy, with a fresh S wind. Best: tomorrow.
