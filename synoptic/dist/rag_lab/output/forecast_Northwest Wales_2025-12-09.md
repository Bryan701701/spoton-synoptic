Today in Northwest Wales, conditions are poor with a swell of 5 ft @ 8s from the SW and fresh 25 mph S winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees an improvement with 6 ft @ 9s WSW swell and lighter 15 mph SSW winds, offering some workable options at spots like Hells Mouth and Porth Oer during the mid-day push. The day after drops to 4 ft @ 8s WSW, still with fresh S winds, keeping it poor across the board. Best: tomorrow.
