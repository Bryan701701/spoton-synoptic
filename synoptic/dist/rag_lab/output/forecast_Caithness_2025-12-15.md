Today in Caithness, it's looking great with 6 ft @10s W swell and light 9 mph S winds. Point of Ness and Murkle Point are prime spots, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, swell builds to 7 ft @13s W, but winds pick up to 18 mph SSW, making it a bit choppy. The day after, conditions drop with 5 ft @10s W and fresh 26 mph SSE winds, so it might be a bit blown out. Best: today.
