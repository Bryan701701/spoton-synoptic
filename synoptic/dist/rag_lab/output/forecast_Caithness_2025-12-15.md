Today in Caithness, it's looking solid with 6 ft @10s W swell and light 9 mph S winds. Great options at Point of Ness and Murkle Point, especially during the morning and early afternoon tides. Tomorrow, swell builds to 7 ft @13s W but winds pick up to 18 mph SSW, making it a bit choppy. The day after, conditions drop to 5 ft @10s W with fresh 26 mph SSE winds, leading to blown-out surf. Best: today.
