Today in Caithness, it's looking great with a solid 6 ft @10s W swell and light 9 mph S winds. Point of Ness and Murkle Point are both firing, especially during the morning and early afternoon tides. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 7 ft @13s W, but watch for fresh 18 mph SSW winds making it a bit choppy. On the day after, conditions drop to 5 ft @10s W with strong 26 mph SSE winds, leading to blown-out surf. Best: today.
