Today in County Sligo, it's looking good with 4 ft @10s NW swell and a light 11 mph SW wind. Strandhill and Easkey spots are clean and fun, especially around their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 6 ft @11s WNW swell but fresh 28 mph WNW winds will make it blown out. The day after, expect 3 ft @6s SSW with 18 mph S winds, keeping things poor across the board. Best: today.
