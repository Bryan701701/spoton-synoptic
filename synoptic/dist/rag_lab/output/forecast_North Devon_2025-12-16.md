North Devon is looking fun today with 3 ft @11s W swell and fresh 17 mph NNW winds. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are both solid options, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 3 ft @10s WSW with lighter 13 mph SSE winds, keeping it workable at the same spots. Day after, swell picks up to 5 ft @13s W, with ESE winds grooming the waves nicely. Best: day after.
