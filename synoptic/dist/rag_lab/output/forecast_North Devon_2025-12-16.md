North Devon is looking fun today with 3 ft @ 11s W swell and fresh 17 mph NNW wind. Best spots include Porlock Weir and Lynmouth, both offering clean conditions. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 3 ft but shifts to 10s WSW with lighter 13 mph SSE winds, keeping it workable at spots like Woolacombe and Croyde Beach. Day after, we see an increase to 5 ft @ 13s W with light ESE winds, making it a solid day at all the usual spots. Best: day after.
