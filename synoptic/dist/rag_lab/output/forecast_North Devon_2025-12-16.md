North Devon is looking good today with 3 ft @11s W swell and fresh 17 mph NNW winds. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are your best bets, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 3 ft @10s WSW swell and lighter 13 mph SSE winds, still offering fun at the same spots. By the day after, the swell picks up to 5 ft @13s W with light 12 mph ESE winds, making it a great time to hit Croyde Beach or Woolacombe. Best: day after.
