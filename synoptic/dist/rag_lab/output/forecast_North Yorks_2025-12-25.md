North Yorks is lighting up today with 3 ft @5s ENE swell and fresh 18 mph ENE winds. Withernsea and Filey are your go-to spots, both offering fun conditions from morning through the afternoon. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 2 ft @5s, but still workable at the same spots with lighter winds. Day after, the swell holds at 2 ft @4s, with a mellow vibe across the coast. Best: today.
