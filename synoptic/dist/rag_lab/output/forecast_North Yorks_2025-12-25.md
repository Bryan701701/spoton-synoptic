North Yorks is looking lively today with 3 ft @5s ENE swell and fresh 18 mph ENE winds. Withernsea and Filey are your best bets, both offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @5s with lighter 13 mph ENE winds, still workable at spots like Withernsea and Filey. By the day after, conditions ease further to 2 ft @4s, but still fun at sheltered corners. Best: today.
