Today in the Hebrides, conditions are poor with a hefty 13 ft @14s WSW swell and fresh 31 mph SW winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 12 ft @14s, but the wind remains fresh at 32 mph SW, keeping it similarly messy. On the day after, the swell continues to decrease to 8 ft @10s with 30 mph SSE winds, still not producing any clean options. Best: none.
