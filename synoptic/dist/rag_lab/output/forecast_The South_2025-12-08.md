Today, the South is feeling the effects of a fresh 25 mph SW wind with 5 ft @9s SSW swell, making it blown out and messy across the board. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with 9 ft @9s S swell and a stronger 30 mph S wind, keeping it poor. By the day after, the swell drops to 6 ft @9s SSW with a lighter 13 mph WSW wind, offering some workable options at spots like Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane during the tide windows. Best: day after.
