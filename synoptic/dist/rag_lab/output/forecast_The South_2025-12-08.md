Today, the South is seeing poor conditions with 5 ft @9s SSW swell, but fresh 25 mph SW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell increases to 9 ft @9s S, but the wind picks up to 30 mph S, keeping it messy. On the day after, conditions improve slightly with 6 ft @9s SSW and lighter 13 mph WSW winds, making it more workable at some spots. Best: day after.
