Today, the South is feeling the effects of a fresh 25 mph SW wind with 5 ft @9s SSW swell, making it blown out and poor across the board. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with a stronger 30 mph S wind and 9 ft @9s S swell, keeping it messy and unworkable. Day after, things improve slightly to 6 ft @9s SSW with a lighter 13 mph WSW wind, offering some workable waves at spots like Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane during the mid-tide push. Best: day after.
