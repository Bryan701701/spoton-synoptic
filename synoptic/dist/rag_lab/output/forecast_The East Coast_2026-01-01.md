Today on the East Coast, conditions are poor with a consistent 3 ft @5s NW swell, but fresh 24 mph NW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell remains at 3 ft, but the period increases to 9s with slightly lighter 22 mph NNW winds, still not ideal. Day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @6s NNE, with 23 mph NW winds continuing to chop it up. Best: tomorrow.
