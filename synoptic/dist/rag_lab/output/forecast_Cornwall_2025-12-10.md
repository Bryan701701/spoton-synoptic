Today in Cornwall, conditions are poor with a fresh 19 mph SW wind creating messy surf at 7 ft @10s across the North coast. Tomorrow, the North sees a slight improvement with 6 ft @11s and lighter 15 mph S winds, making it more workable. By the day after, the North lights up with 7 ft @14s and light winds, offering great conditions. Best: day after.
