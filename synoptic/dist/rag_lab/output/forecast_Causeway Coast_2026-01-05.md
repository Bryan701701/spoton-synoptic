Today, the Causeway Coast is seeing poor conditions with 5 ft @7s NNW swell, but fresh 26 mph NNW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, expect a drop to 3 ft @6s NW with similar fresh 25 mph WSW winds, still not producing. The day after brings a slight improvement with 4 ft @7s NNW, but winds remain fresh at 25 mph, keeping it messy. Best: day after.
