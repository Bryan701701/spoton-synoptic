Today, the North East is lighting up with solid 7 ft @9s N swell and fresh 16 mph WNW winds. Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach are great picks, especially during the morning tides. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 5 ft @8s N, but with lighter 11 mph W winds, it should still be fun at spots like Redcar and Coatham Sands. Day after, conditions decline with 4 ft @7s N and fresh 23 mph NW winds, making it less appealing. Best: today.
