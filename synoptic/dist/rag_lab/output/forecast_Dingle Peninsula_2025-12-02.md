Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it's a flat day with no surf energy—just 0 ft @0s and calm N winds. Tomorrow sees a slight bump with 13 ft @12s WNW, but fresh 19 mph W winds will keep it messy. The day after, conditions drop to 9 ft @11s W, still with fresh 24 mph WNW winds, making it another blown-out session. Best: tomorrow.
