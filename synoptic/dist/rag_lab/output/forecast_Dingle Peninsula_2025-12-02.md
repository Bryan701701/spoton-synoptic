Today on the Dingle Peninsula, conditions are poor with 0 ft @ 0 s and no surfable waves. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 13 ft @ 12 s WNW but remains blown out by fresh 19 mph W winds, making it unworkable. The day after, the swell drops to 9 ft @ 11 s W, still with fresh 24 mph WNW winds, keeping it messy. Best: tomorrow.
