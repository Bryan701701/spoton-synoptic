Today in Sutherland, it's a quiet scene with 0 ft @ 0 s and no surf energy. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 9 ft @ 8 s, but fresh 37 mph SW winds will make it blown out. Day after, conditions improve slightly with 10 ft @ 10 s, but only Strathy shows some potential with workable winds at 14 mph W. Best: day after.
