Today in Gower, conditions are poor with 3 ft @9s W swell and fresh 19 mph NW winds. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 7 ft @8s SW, but strong 32 mph SW winds will make it challenging. Day after, we see a nice improvement with 6 ft @8s WSW swell and light 10 mph SSW winds, offering some clean options at spots like Llangennith Beach. Best: day after.
