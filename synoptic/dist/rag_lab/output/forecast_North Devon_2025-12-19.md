Today in North Devon, it’s looking solid with 7 ft @10s W swell and fresh 17 mph WSW winds. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are both working well, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @10s WSW, but with lighter 13 mph ESE winds, it should still be fun at spots like Woolacombe and Putsborough. Day after, conditions improve with 4 ft @13s W swell and light 5 mph SE winds, making it a great day for a surf session at any of the local beaches. Best: day after.
