Today in Moray, it's looking good with 2 ft @ 7s ENE swell and light 8 mph SSW winds. Fraserburgh and Pennan are your best bets, both working well throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop slightly to 2 ft @ 6s E with a fresh 12 mph SW wind, making it a bit choppy—Spey Bay and Lossiemouth are still worth a look. Day after, the swell fades to 1 ft @ 4s ESE, with winds picking up to 14 mph SE, so it’s best to give it a miss. Best: today.
