Today in Moray, it's looking good with 2 ft @7s ENE swell and light 8 mph SSW winds. Fraserburgh and Pennan are your top picks, offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @6s with a fresh 12 mph SW wind, making it a bit choppy, but Spey Bay and Lossiemouth still have some potential. By the day after, conditions worsen with 1 ft @4s ESE swell and 14 mph SE winds, so it’s best to skip it. Best: today.
