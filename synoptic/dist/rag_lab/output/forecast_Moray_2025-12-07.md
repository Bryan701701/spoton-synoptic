Today in Moray, it's looking good with 2 ft @7s ENE swell and light 8 mph SSW winds. Fraserburgh and Pennan are prime spots, both offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop slightly to 2 ft @6s with a fresh 12 mph SW wind, making it a bit choppy; Spey Bay and Lossiemouth are your best bets. The day after, expect smaller 1 ft @4s ESE waves with 14 mph SE winds, so it’s best to give it a miss. Best: today.
