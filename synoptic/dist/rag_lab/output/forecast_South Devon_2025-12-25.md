Today in South Devon, it's looking poor with 6 ft @7s E swell and fresh 13 mph NE wind. The conditions are blown out, so it’s best to give it a miss. Tomorrow sees a drop to 3 ft @5s ESE with light 6 mph ENE winds, but still not producing much. Day after, conditions worsen with 4 ft @6s E swell and strong 29 mph ENE winds, making it quite choppy. Best: tomorrow.
