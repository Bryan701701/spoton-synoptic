Today in South Devon, Bantham is showing some workable surf at 2 ft @ 8s WSW with fresh 14 mph WNW winds. It's a good time to hit the water, especially during the tide window from 08:52 to 17:15. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 6 ft @ 7s SW swell but fresh 21 mph SSW winds will make it blown out and poor. By the day after, we see a nice improvement with 5 ft @ 8s SW swell and light 9 mph WSW winds, making it a great day to surf at spots like Bantham. Best: day after.
