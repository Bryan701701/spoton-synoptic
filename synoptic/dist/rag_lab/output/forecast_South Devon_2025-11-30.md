Today in South Devon, Bantham is offering some fun with 2 ft @8s WSW swell and fresh 14 mph WNW winds. It's a workable day, especially during the tide window from 08:52 to 17:15. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 6 ft @7s SW with fresh 21 mph SSW winds, making it blown out and not ideal. Day after, things improve with 5 ft @8s SW and light 9 mph WSW winds, perfect for a clean session at Bantham or Challborough. Best: day after.
