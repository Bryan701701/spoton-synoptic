Today in South Devon, Bantham is showing some potential with 2 ft @ 8s WSW and a fresh 14 mph WNW wind. It’s a workable option, especially during the tide window from 08:52 to 17:15. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 6 ft @ 7s SW with a stronger 21 mph SSW wind, making it blown out and poor across the board. By the day after, things improve with 5 ft @ 8s SW and light 9 mph WSW winds, offering clean surf at Bantham, Bovisand Reef, and Challborough. Best: day after.
