Today, the South is seeing some small but workable surf at 1 ft @ 5s SW with fresh 15 mph WNW winds. Derrynane and Barley Cove are your best bets, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 1 ft @ 7s SW and light 2 mph SSE winds, making it a fun day for a glide. The day after, expect 3 ft @ 9s SW but with fresh 20 mph W winds, likely making it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
