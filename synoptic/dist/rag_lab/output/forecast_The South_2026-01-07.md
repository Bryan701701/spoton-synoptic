Today in The South, there's some fun small surf at 1ft @5s SW with fresh 15 mph WNW winds. Sheltered corners like Derrynane and Barley Cove are working well. Tomorrow, conditions improve with a cleaner 1ft @7s SW and light 2 mph SSE winds, making it a great day for a session. The day after, expect 3ft @9s SW, but fresh 20 mph W winds will make it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
