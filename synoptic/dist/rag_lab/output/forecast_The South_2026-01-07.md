Today in The South, we've got some small but workable surf at 1 ft @ 5s SW with fresh 15 mph WNW winds. Derrynane and Barley Cove are your best bets, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 1 ft @ 7s SW and light 2 mph SSE winds, making for a cleaner experience. The day after, expect 3 ft @ 9s SW but fresh 20 mph W winds will likely make it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
