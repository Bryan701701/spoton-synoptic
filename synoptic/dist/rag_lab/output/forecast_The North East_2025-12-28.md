Today in the North East, it's looking solid with 4 ft @ 8s NNE swell and a moderate 11 mph NE wind. Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach are prime spots, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 3 ft @ 9s, but still offers some fun waves at sheltered locations like Coatham Sands and Hartlepool. By the day after, conditions remain similar with 4 ft @ 8s, but winds pick up to 17 mph NNE, so expect a bit more chop. Best: today.
