Today in the North East, it's looking solid with 4 ft @ 8s NNE swell and a moderate 11 mph NE wind. Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach are prime spots, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 3 ft @ 9s, still workable but with a fresh 13 mph N wind. The day after, conditions remain similar with 4 ft @ 8s, but the wind picks up to 17 mph NNE, making it a bit choppy. Best: today.
