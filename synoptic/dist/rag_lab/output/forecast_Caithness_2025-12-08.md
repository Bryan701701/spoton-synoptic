Today in Caithness, surf is looking decent with 3 ft @ 7s ESE across several spots. Ackergill, Sinclair's Bay, Keiss, and Freswick Bay are all working, but expect a fresh SSW wind at 15 mph. Tomorrow, conditions change with a drop to 1 ft @ 5s ESE, making it less appealing. By the day after, we see a significant swell increase to 10 ft @ 10s W, but fresh SW winds at 43 mph will likely blow it out. Best: today.
