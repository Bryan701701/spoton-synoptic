Today in Caithness, surf is looking decent with 3 ft @ 7s ESE across several spots like Ackergill and Sinclair's Bay, although winds are fresh at 15 mph SSW. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 3 ft @ 13s W from the W, making spots like Point of Ness and Dunnet Bay more appealing with moderate SSE winds. Day after, expect a significant increase to 10 ft @ 10s W, but strong 43 mph SW winds will make it challenging. Best: tomorrow.
