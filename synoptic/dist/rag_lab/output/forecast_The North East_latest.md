Today at Saltburn Beach, expect clean conditions with a small but fun 1 ft @ 6s SE swell and a moderate 11 mph SW wind. The best time to hit the water is between 08:23 and 15:38. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2 ft @ 5s S with fresh 20 mph SSW winds, making it less appealing. Day after, the swell fades further to 1 ft @ 3s S, with light winds, but still not producing much. Best: today.
