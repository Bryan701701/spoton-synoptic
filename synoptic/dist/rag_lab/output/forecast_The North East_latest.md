Today, the North East is quiet with 2 ft @8s NE swell, but fresh 22 mph SSE winds are making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 2 ft @6s ESE swell and lighter 10 mph S winds, making for some fun, clean surf at spots like South Shields and Saltburn Beach. Day after, the swell picks up slightly to 3 ft @6s ESE, but fresh 19 mph S winds will likely keep it messy. Best: tomorrow.
