Today, the North East is flat with no surf energy—just a calm day out there. Tomorrow, we see a slight bump to 3 ft @ 6s with fresh ESE winds, but it’ll be a bit choppy. The day after, similar 3 ft @ 6s conditions continue, still with ESE winds, but it should be more manageable at sheltered spots like South Shields. Best: day after.
