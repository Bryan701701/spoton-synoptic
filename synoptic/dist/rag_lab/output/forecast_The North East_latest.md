Today is looking quiet with 1 ft @4s SW across the North East, and fresh 14 mph SW winds creating some chop. Tomorrow, Saltburn Beach lights up with 2 ft @6s ESE and moderate 12 mph WSW winds, making it the best option. The day after, conditions drop back to 1 ft @8s NNE, still workable at Saltburn but not as lively. Best: tomorrow.
