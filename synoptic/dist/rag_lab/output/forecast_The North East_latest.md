Today, the North East is showing some fun options with 2 ft @ 8s NNE swell and fresh 17 mph W winds. Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands are both working well, with the best windows from 08:24 to 15:55. Tomorrow, conditions drop as the swell shifts to 3 ft @ 6s NNW with strong 35 mph NW winds, making it blown out across the region. Day after, expect a nice recovery with 3 ft @ 8s NE swell and light 9 mph S winds, perfect for a surf session. Best: day after.
