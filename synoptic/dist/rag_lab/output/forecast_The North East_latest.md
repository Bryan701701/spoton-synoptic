The North East is looking solid over the next three days! Today, enjoy clean 3 ft @ 6s waves with ESE winds at 11 mph. Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach are prime spots, especially around their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 3 ft @ 6s and the same wind, making it another great day at Saltburn and nearby beaches. On Christmas Day, the swell drops slightly to 3 ft @ 5s, and winds pick up to 16 mph, but spots like Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands will still be fun. Best: today.
