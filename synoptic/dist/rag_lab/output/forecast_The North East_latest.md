Today in the North East, it's a quiet scene with 2 ft @6s NNW lines and fresh 13 mph WNW winds making it a bit blown out. Tomorrow looks much better as swell builds to 3 ft @8s NE with light 5 mph W winds, offering some clean conditions at spots like Saltburn Beach. The day after continues the trend with 4 ft @6s ENE swell and similar light winds, perfect for a fun session. Best: tomorrow.
