Today, the North East is looking solid with 3 ft @ 7s ESE swell and fresh 17 mph S winds. Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach are both working well, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 1 ft @ 6s ENE, making it a quiet day across the region. Day after, still small at 1 ft @ 5s N, but Saltburn Beach might offer some fun for those looking to paddle out. Best: today.
