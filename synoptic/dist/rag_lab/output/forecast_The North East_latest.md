Today, the North East is seeing some fun options with 2 ft @8s NNE swell and a fresh 17 mph W wind. Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands are both working well, with the best tides from 08:24 to 15:55. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @6s NNW with a strong 35 mph NW wind, making it blown out and poor across the region. By the day after, the swell picks back up to 3 ft @8s NE with light 9 mph S winds, creating cleaner conditions—great for a surf session! Best: day after.
