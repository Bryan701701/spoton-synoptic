Today at Saltburn Beach, it's looking fun with 2 ft @ 6s SE and a light 12 mph SSW wind. Best conditions are on the push from 08:20 to 15:37. Tomorrow drops to 1 ft @ 6s with a gentle 8 mph W wind, still workable for beginners. Day after, conditions fade to 1 ft @ 3s with fresh 20 mph S winds, making it blown out. Best: today.
