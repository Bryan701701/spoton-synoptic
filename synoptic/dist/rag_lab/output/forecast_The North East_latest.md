Today, the North East is lighting up with 3 ft @ 7s ESE swell and fresh 17 mph S winds. Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach are your best bets, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 1 ft @ 6s ENE with light SW winds, making it a flat day. By the day after, things stay small at 1 ft @ 5s N, but Saltburn Beach might still offer a fun little wave. Best: today.
