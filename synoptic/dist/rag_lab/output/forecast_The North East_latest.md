Today, the North East is seeing some fun surf at 2 ft @ 5s ESE with a fresh 17 mph SE wind. Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands are your best bets, especially during their prime tides. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 3 ft @ 6s E swell, still with a moderate ESE wind—great for a solid session at spots like South Shields and Roker Pier. Day after, the swell holds at 3 ft @ 6s E with similar winds, keeping the vibe lively at Hartlepool and Marsden. Best: tomorrow.
