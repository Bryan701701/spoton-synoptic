Today is looking pretty quiet with 1 ft @ 4s S swell across the North East. Fresh 18 mph SSW winds are making it blown out, so best to give it a miss. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 3 ft @ 5s ESE swell, but the 19 mph SE winds will still keep it choppy. Day after brings 4 ft @ 6s E swell with lighter 12 mph ESE winds, making it more workable, especially at spots like Saltburn Beach. Best: day after.
