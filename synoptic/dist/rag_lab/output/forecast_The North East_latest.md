Today, the North East is lighting up with clean 3 ft @9s NNE swell and light 10 mph SSW winds. Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands are prime spots, both offering fun conditions from 09:04 to 16:41. Tomorrow sees a drop to 2 ft @8s with similar winds, but Saltburn Beach remains the standout. By the day after, conditions ease further to 2 ft @6s, still workable at sheltered corners. Best: today.
