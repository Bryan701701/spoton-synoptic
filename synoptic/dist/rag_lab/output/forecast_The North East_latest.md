Today, the North East is lighting up with 4 ft @ 7s E swell and fresh 17 mph ESE winds. Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach are prime spots, especially around their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @ 5s E with fresh 20 mph E winds, making it a poor day for surf. By the day after, we see a slight improvement with 2 ft @ 5s E and lighter 9 mph ENE winds, offering some fun options at sheltered spots like Coatham Sands and Roker Pier. Best: today.
