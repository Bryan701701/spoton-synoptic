Today, the North East is facing some challenging conditions with 5 ft @8s N swell but fresh 25 mph WNW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 3 ft @8s NNE swell and 17 mph WSW winds, offering some workable options at spots like Saltburn Beach. The day after, conditions worsen again with 5 ft @6s N swell and strong 36 mph NNW winds, leading to poor surf. Best: tomorrow.
