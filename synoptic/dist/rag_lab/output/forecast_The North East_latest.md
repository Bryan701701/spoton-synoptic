Today, the North East is lighting up with clean 3 ft @ 7s ESE swell and a moderate 12 mph S wind. Great options at Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands, both working well throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 1 ft @ 6s WNW with fresh 13 mph SW winds, making it a flat day. Day after, a slight improvement to 2 ft @ 4s SSW at Saltburn Beach, but still not ideal with 18 mph SW winds. Best: today.
