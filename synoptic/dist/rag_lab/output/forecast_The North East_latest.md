Today, the North East is lighting up with solid 7 ft @10s N swell and fresh 17 mph WNW winds. Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach are great picks, especially early on the tide. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 5 ft @8s N with fresh 30 mph NW winds, making it a poor day for surf. By the day after, we see a slight improvement to 4 ft @8s N with lighter 12 mph WNW winds, still workable at sheltered spots. Best: today.
