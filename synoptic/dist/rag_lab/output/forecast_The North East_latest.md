Today in the North East, it's a fun day with 2 ft @ 6s E swell and light 6 mph SW winds. Good spots like Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands are working nicely, especially on the push. Tomorrow sees a drop to 3 ft @ 6s ESE with fresh 18 mph S winds, making it poor across the board. Day after, conditions remain poor with 1 ft @ 6s E and light 7 mph SW winds. Best: today.
