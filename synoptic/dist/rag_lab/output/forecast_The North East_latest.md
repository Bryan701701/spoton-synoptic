Today, the North East is quiet with 2 ft @8s NE swell, but fresh 22 mph SSE wind is making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow looks better with 2 ft @6s ESE, lightening up to a moderate 10 mph S wind, making for clean conditions at spots like South Shields and Saltburn Beach. The day after, the swell increases slightly to 3 ft @6s ESE, but fresh 19 mph S wind will keep it choppy. Best: tomorrow.
