Today is looking pretty flat across the North East with 1 ft @4s swell and fresh 18 mph SSW winds. Tomorrow, the swell picks up a bit to 3 ft @5s, but the SE wind at 19 mph will keep it messy. By the day after, conditions improve with 4 ft @6s swell and lighter 12 mph ESE winds, making for some workable waves at spots like Saltburn Beach and South Shields. Best: day after.
