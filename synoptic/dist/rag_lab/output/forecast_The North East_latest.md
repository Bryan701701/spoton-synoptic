Today, Saltburn Beach is offering some fun with 1 ft @ 7s ENE and a fresh 15 mph SSW wind. It's a good time to hit the water, especially during the tide window from 09:06 to 16:40. Tomorrow, the swell bumps up to 2 ft @ 6s ESE, but with a strong 27 mph SSE wind, conditions will be poor across the region. Day after, we see similar 2 ft @ 8s NE, but winds ease back to 15 mph SSW, making Saltburn Beach a better bet again. Best: today.
