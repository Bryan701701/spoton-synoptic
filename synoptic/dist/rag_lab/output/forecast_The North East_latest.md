Today at Saltburn Beach, expect 1ft @ 7s NE with fresh 14 mph SSW wind. It’s a bit on the small side, but sheltered corners are working. Tomorrow sees a slight increase to 2ft @ 4s SSW, still with fresh wind, so keep an eye on the conditions. Day after, Saltburn holds 2ft @ 5s SSE with similar winds, making for fun surf. Best: today.
