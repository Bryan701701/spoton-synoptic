Today, the North East is seeing some fun surf with 3 ft @ 5s E at spots like Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands, though winds are fresh at 18 mph ENE. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 2 ft @ 5s E, and lighter winds at 10 mph ENE, making it a good day for a mellow session. By the day after, the surf drops to 2 ft @ 4s ENE with fresh NNE winds, making it less appealing. Best: tomorrow.
