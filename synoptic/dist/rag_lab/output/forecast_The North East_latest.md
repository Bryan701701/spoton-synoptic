Today in the North East, surf is looking solid with 7 ft @ 9s N swell and fresh 16 mph WNW wind. Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach are both prime spots, especially early on the push. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 5 ft @ 8s N with moderate 11 mph W wind, still offering good conditions at various beaches. By the day after, conditions decline with 4 ft @ 7s N and fresh 23 mph NW wind, making it less inviting. Best: today.
