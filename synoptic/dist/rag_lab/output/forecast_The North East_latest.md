Today in the North East, it's looking good with 3 ft @ 5s E swell and a fresh 12 mph ENE wind. Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands are prime spots to catch some fun waves, especially between 08:26 and 15:42. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 1 ft @ 5s E with a moderate 15 mph NNE wind, making it a quiet day. By the day after, conditions improve to 4 ft @ 7s NE, with Saltburn Beach and other spots lighting up again. Best: today.
