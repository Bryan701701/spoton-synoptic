Today, the North East is flat with no surf action—wrong swell angle and fresh SSW winds at 25 mph. Tomorrow drops further to 1 ft @3s, still with onshore winds at 12 mph, keeping it quiet. The day after brings a slight improvement with 2 ft @4s ESE, light winds at 8 mph, making Saltburn Beach the best bet during the mid-tide window. Best: day after.
