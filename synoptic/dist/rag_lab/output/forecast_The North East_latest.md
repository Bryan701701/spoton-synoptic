Today in the North East, it's a fun day with 2 ft @ 6s E swell and light 6 mph SW winds. Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands are your best bets, with optimal tides from 08:09 to 15:40. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @ 6s ESE but with fresh 18 mph S winds, making it poor across the board. The day after, we see a further decline to 1 ft @ 6s E, still under 7 mph SW winds. Best: today.
