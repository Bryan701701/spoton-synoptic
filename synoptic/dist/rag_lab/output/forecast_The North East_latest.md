Today, the North East is lighting up with clean 2 ft @ 6s E swell and light 6 mph SW winds. Great options at Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands, both working well throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @ 6s E with fresh 18 mph S winds, making it blown out and poor across the board. The day after, it fades further to 1 ft @ 6s E with similar winds, keeping it flat and unworkable. Best: today.
