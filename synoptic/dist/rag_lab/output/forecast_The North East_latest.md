Today, the North East is seeing some fun surf at 3 ft @ 6s ENE with a fresh 13 mph NE wind. Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach are your best bets, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions improve with swell building to 5 ft @ 8s ENE and light 5 mph SE winds, making for clean and fun waves. Day after, expect a drop back to 3 ft @ 6s with fresh 27 mph S winds, likely making it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
