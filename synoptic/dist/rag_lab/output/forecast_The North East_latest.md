Today, the North East is quiet with a weak 2 ft @4s S swell and fresh 25 mph SW wind, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 2 ft @5s SSE at Saltburn Beach, but still on the lower end of the scale with 14 mph SSW winds. The day after brings 1 ft @6s ESE, with light 10 mph WNW winds, making it a mellow day for longboarders. Best: tomorrow.
