The North East is looking solid today with 3 ft @ 5s E swell and a moderate 12 mph ENE wind. Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands are prime spots, both working well from 08:26 to 15:42. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 1 ft @ 5s E with a fresh 15 mph NNE wind, making it a quiet day. By the day after, we see a nice rebound to 4 ft @ 7s NE with similar winds, offering fun conditions at several spots. Best: today.
