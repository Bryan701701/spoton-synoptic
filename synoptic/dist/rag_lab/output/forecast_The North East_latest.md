Today, the North East is lighting up with 3ft @9s NNE swell and light SSW winds. Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands are prime spots, offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2ft @8s NE, still workable at Saltburn Beach but overall a quieter day. By the day after, conditions remain similar with 2ft @6s E, but a bit more wind in the mix. Best: today.
