Today in the North East, it’s a bit rough with 7 ft @9s N swell and fresh 25 mph WNW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 5 ft @8s N swell and lighter 14 mph WNW winds, offering some workable conditions at spots like Saltburn Beach. The day after drops further to 3 ft @8s NNE, still with fresh winds, making it a quiet day. Best: tomorrow.
