Today, the North East is quiet with 2 ft @4s S swell and fresh 26 mph SW wind, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow drops to 1 ft @3s SSW with light 10 mph SW wind, still not producing. Day after, Saltburn Beach shows some promise with 2 ft @6s ESE and moderate 18 mph S wind, offering a workable window. Best: day after.
