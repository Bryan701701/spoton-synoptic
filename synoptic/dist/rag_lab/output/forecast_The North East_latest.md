Today in the North East, Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach are lighting up with solid 5 ft @ 9s NNE swell and a light NNE wind at 12 mph. Expect clean conditions, especially at Saltburn Beach from 08:26 to 15:46. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 4 ft @ 10s with a fresh W wind at 18 mph, making it a bit choppy but still workable at spots like Saltburn and Redcar. On January 1st, conditions deteriorate with 3 ft @ 8s NNW and strong WNW winds at 25 mph, leading to blown-out surf. Best: today.
