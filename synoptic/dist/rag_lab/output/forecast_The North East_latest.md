Today in the North East, it's a solid 3 ft @ 9s NNE with a light 10 mph SSW wind. Great conditions at spots like Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands, especially on the push from 09:04 to 16:41. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 8s NE, still workable at Saltburn Beach but not much else. By the day after, it remains around 2 ft @ 6s E, with a bit of wind, so expect a quieter day. Best: today.
