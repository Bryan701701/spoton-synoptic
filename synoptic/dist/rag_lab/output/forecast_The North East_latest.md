Today in the North East, surf is looking solid at 4 ft @ 7s with a fresh 17 mph ESE wind. Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach are both working well, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @ 5s with a stronger 20 mph E wind, making it a poor day for surf. By the day after, we see a slight recovery to 2 ft @ 5s, with lighter 9 mph ENE winds, making it more manageable at spots like Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands. Best: today.
