Today, Saltburn Beach is offering clean 1 ft @ 6s ENE with light 5 mph SW winds, making for a fun session during the tide window from 08:11 to 15:38. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 1 ft @ 4s SSW, with gentle 4 mph SSE winds; still workable but less punchy. On the day after, expect 1 ft @ 3s SE with 9 mph SE winds, keeping it playful but on the smaller side. Best: today.
