Today in the North East, it's looking solid with clean 3 ft @ 7s ESE swell and a light 12 mph S wind. Great spots like Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands are firing, especially from 08:17 to 15:37. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 1 ft @ 6s WNW with fresh 13 mph SW winds, so it’s best to give it a miss. Day after, Saltburn Beach offers 2 ft @ 4s SSW, but with 18 mph SW winds, it’s only OK. Best: today.
