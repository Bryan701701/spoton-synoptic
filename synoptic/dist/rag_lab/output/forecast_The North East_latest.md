Today in the North East, it's looking great with 3 ft @ 6s E swell and a moderate 11 mph ESE wind. Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach are prime spots, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 3 ft @ 6s E swell and the same wind, keeping the fun going at Saltburn and nearby beaches. On Christmas Day, the swell drops slightly to 3 ft @ 5s E with a fresh 16 mph E wind, making it a bit choppy, but spots like Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands will still have some rideable waves. Best: today.
