Today, the North East is flat with no surf activity—data not available. Tomorrow, conditions improve with a solid 7 ft @10s N swell and moderate 16 mph WNW winds, making for some fun waves at spots like Saltburn Beach and Redcar. Day after, expect 6 ft @8s N swell but fresh 32 mph NW winds will make it blown out and messy. Best: tomorrow.
