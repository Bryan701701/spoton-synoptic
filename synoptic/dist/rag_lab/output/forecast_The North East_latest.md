Today is looking pretty quiet with 1 ft @3s SSE across the North East. The wind is fresh at 10 mph S, making it a bit choppy. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 1 ft @5s SSE, but the wind picks up to 16 mph SSW, keeping it messy. On the day after, we see a small bump to 2 ft @4s SSW, but the fresh 19 mph SSW wind will still keep it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
