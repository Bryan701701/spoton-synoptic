Today, the North East is quiet with 2 ft @4s S swell and fresh 25 mph SW winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow brings a slight improvement with 2 ft @5s SSE swell and lighter 14 mph SSW winds; Saltburn Beach may be the best bet for some fun. Day after, conditions drop to 1 ft @6s ESE with light 10 mph WNW winds, still offering a mellow vibe but not much power. Best: tomorrow.
