Today is quiet across the North East with no surf energy, as the swell isn't hitting this coast. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 3 ft @ 6s E, but the wind will be fresh at 12 mph ESE, making it a bit choppy. The day after looks better, with similar 3 ft @ 6s E conditions but lighter winds at 9 mph ESE, offering a more enjoyable surf experience. Best: day after.
