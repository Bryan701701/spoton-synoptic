Today at Saltburn Beach, expect clean conditions with 1 ft @ 5s ESE and light 7 mph S winds. It's a great time to catch some fun, small waves. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 1 ft @ 4s ESE with fresh 16 mph SE winds, making it less appealing. The day after, Saltburn Beach sees a slight bump to 2 ft @ 4s SSW, but the fresh winds will still keep it choppy. Best: today.
