Today in the North East, it's looking solid with 3 ft @9s NNE swell and light 10 mph SSW winds. Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands are prime spots, working well throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @8s NE with similar winds, so Saltburn Beach remains the best bet. Day after, conditions ease further to 2 ft @6s E, but still some fun at Saltburn and Coatham. Best: today.
