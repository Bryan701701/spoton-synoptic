Today in the North East, it's looking fun with clean 2 ft @ 6s E swell and light 6 mph SW winds. Good spots like Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands will be working well, especially on the push from 08:09 to 15:40. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 3 ft @ 6s ESE swell but fresh 18 mph S winds will make it blown out across the board. The day after, we see a decline to 1 ft @ 6s E, still with 7 mph SW winds, making it a quiet day. Best: today.
