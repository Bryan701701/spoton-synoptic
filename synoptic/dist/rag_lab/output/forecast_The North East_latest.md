Today in the North East, it's looking good with 4 ft @ 8s NE swell and a moderate 14 mph W wind. Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach are prime spots, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 6s ENE with light 11 mph NE winds, still offering fun waves at various locations. By the day after, we're back up to 4 ft @ 8s ENE with light 3 mph SW winds, making it a perfect day for a surf session. Best: day after.
