Today in the North East, surf is looking fun with 3 ft @ 5s E and fresh 18 mph ENE winds. Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands are your best bets, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions ease a bit with 2 ft @ 5s E and lighter 10 mph ENE winds, still offering some playful options. By the day after, it drops to 2 ft @ 4s ENE, and fresh NNE winds may make it a bit choppy. Best: today.
