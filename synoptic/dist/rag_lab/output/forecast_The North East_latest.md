Today, Saltburn Beach is showing some fun 2 ft @ 5s E with a fresh 14 mph NNE wind. It's a bit choppy, but sheltered corners should be workable. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 3 ft @ 7s NE swell across multiple spots, including Saltburn and Redcar, all with the same fresh wind. Day after, the swell holds at 3 ft @ 8s NNE, still offering good options at Saltburn and Coatham Sands. Best: tomorrow.
