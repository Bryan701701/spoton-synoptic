Today in North Devon, surf is small at 1 ft @6s with fresh 9 mph ESE winds. It's not producing much, so best to give it a miss. Tomorrow sees a slight bump to 2 ft @6s with similar winds; still not ideal but a bit more to work with. The day after drops back to 1 ft @8s, keeping the trend of poor conditions. Best: tomorrow.
