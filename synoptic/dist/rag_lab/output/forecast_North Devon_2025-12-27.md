Today in North Devon, it's looking pretty quiet with 1 ft @ 6s NE swell and fresh 9 mph ESE winds. Tomorrow sees a slight bump to 2 ft @ 6s ENE, but still not much to get excited about, with winds holding at 11 mph E. The day after drops back to 1 ft @ 8s NE, keeping the trend of minimal surf. Best: tomorrow.
