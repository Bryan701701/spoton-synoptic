Today, Gower is seeing poor conditions with 8 ft @10s WSW swell and fresh 27 mph SW winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 6 ft @10s WSW swell and moderate 14 mph S winds, offering some workable options at spots like Llangennith Beach. The day after, we get even better conditions with 5 ft @12s WSW swell and light 9 mph NW winds, making it a great day to hit the water. Best: day after.
