Today on Gower, surf is looking solid with 3 ft @9s SW at spots like Llangennith Beach and Broughton Bay, though winds are fresh at 18 mph E. Tomorrow, expect a drop to 2 ft @7s SSW, still workable at Llangennith Beach and Horton, but the wind remains light at 13 mph E. By the day after, conditions improve slightly with 2 ft @7s SSW, and light ENE winds, making it a good day for a mellow surf at Llangennith Beach. Best: today.
