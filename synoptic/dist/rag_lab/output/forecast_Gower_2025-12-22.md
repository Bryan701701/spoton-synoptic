Gower is lighting up today with 3 ft @9s SW swell and fresh 18 mph E winds. Llangennith Beach and Broughton Bay are your top picks, both offering clean conditions during the best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @7s SSW with moderate E winds; still some fun at Llangennith and Horton. Day after, conditions ease further to 2 ft @7s SSW with light ENE winds, making for a relaxed surf day. Best: today.
