Today, the North East is quiet with 1 ft @5s SE lines and fresh 14 mph S wind; not producing much. Tomorrow, the swell remains at 1 ft @5s N with a stronger 20 mph WSW wind, keeping it blown out. Day after shows a slight improvement with Saltburn Beach offering 1 ft @4s SSE, but still not ideal. Best: day after.
