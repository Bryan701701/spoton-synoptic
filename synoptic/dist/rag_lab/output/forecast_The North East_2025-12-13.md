Today, Saltburn Beach is offering some fun, clean conditions with 1ft @ 7s NE swell and a moderate 14 mph SSW wind. It’s a great time to catch some small waves, especially during the tide window from 08:18 to 15:37. Tomorrow, expect a slight increase to 2ft @ 4s SSW, but the wind will pick up to 16 mph SW, making it a bit choppy. Day after, the swell holds at 2ft @ 5s SSE with similar wind conditions. Best: today.
