Today, Saltburn Beach is offering some fun, clean conditions with a swell of 1ft @ 7s NE and a moderate 14 mph SSW wind. It's a great time to hit the water, especially during the tide window from 08:18 to 15:37. Tomorrow, the swell builds slightly to 2ft @ 4s SSW, but the wind picks up to 16 mph, making it a bit choppy. Day after, the swell remains at 2ft but shifts to 5s SSE with similar wind conditions. Best: today.
