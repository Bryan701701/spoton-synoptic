Today, Saltburn Beach is serving up some fun with 1 ft @ 7s NE swell and a fresh 14 mph SSW breeze. It's a bit on the small side, but sheltered corners will be workable. Tomorrow, the swell picks up slightly to 2 ft @ 4s SSW, still with a moderate 16 mph SW wind, so expect some choppy conditions. Day after, the swell remains at 2 ft @ 5s SSE, with similar wind, keeping it consistent but a bit bumpy. Best: today.
