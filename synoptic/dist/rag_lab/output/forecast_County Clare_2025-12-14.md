County Clare is looking solid today with 6 ft @10s WSW swell and fresh 16 mph SSW winds. Doolin Point and Lahinch Beach are great picks, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 6 ft @12s W swell and light 5 mph SSE winds, making for a fun day at all spots. The day after, expect 9 ft @13s W swell with fresh 17 mph WSW winds, so look for sheltered corners to catch some waves. Best: tomorrow.
