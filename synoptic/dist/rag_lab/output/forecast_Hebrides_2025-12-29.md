Today in the Hebrides, clean conditions with 4 ft @ 11s NW swell and light 3 mph ENE winds. Best spots include Tolsta and Port of Ness, both offering fun waves from mid-morning to afternoon. Tomorrow, the swell builds slightly to 5 ft @ 12s NNE, with similar light winds, keeping it clean and enjoyable. On the day after, expect 4 ft @ 9s NNW but fresh 20 mph W winds will make it blown out and poor across the region. Best: tomorrow.
