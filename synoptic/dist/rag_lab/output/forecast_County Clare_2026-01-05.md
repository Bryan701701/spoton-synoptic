Today in County Clare, surf is on the smaller side at 2 ft @6s with light NNE winds. It’s a bit of a quiet day, so best to give it a miss. Tomorrow sees an uptick with 3 ft @5s WNW, and winds shifting to 11 mph WSW, making for some good options at spots like Lahinch Beach. The day after holds similar conditions with 3 ft @7s NW, but winds pick up to 17 mph NW, so look for sheltered corners. Best: tomorrow.
