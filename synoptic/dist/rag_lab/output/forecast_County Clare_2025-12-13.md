Today in County Clare, conditions are poor with a steady 5 ft @ 13s W swell, but fresh 21 mph S winds are making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees an increase to 9 ft @ 10s WSW, but with even stronger 25 mph SSW winds, it's still not looking good. By the day after, the swell drops to a more manageable 4 ft @ 11s W, with light 6 mph SSE winds offering a chance for cleaner surf at spots like Lahinch Beach. Best: day after.
