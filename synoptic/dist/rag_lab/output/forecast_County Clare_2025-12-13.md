Today in County Clare, it's a bit of a bummer with flat conditions—no surf energy and fresh onshore winds at 21 mph. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 9 ft @10s WSW, but it's still blown out by 25 mph SSW winds, making it poor across the board. Day after brings a nice change with 4 ft @11s W and light 6 mph SSE winds, creating clean conditions at spots like Lahinch Beach and Cornish Left. Best: day after.
