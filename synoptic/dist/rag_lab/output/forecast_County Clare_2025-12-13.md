Today in County Clare, it’s a quiet scene with 5 ft @13s W swell, but fresh 21 mph S winds are making it blown out everywhere. Tomorrow, expect a bump to 9 ft @10s WSW, but the fresh 25 mph SSW winds will keep it messy and challenging. By the day after, conditions improve with 4 ft @11s W swell and light 6 mph SSE winds, making for clean surf at spots like Lahinch Beach and Cornish Left. Best: day after.
