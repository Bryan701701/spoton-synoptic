Today in County Clare, it's a flat day with no surf action, as the swell isn't hitting this coast. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with a fresh 25 mph SSW wind and a 9 ft @10s WSW swell, making it blown out across the board. Day after brings a nice change with 4 ft @11s W swell and light 6 mph SSE winds, making it clean and fun at spots like Lahinch Beach and Lahinch Left. Best: day after.
