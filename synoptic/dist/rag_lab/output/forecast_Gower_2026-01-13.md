Today, Gower is firing with 4ft @9s WSW swell and light 9 mph S winds. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are your top picks, both offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, expect a slight drop to 3ft @11s with light 5 mph WNW winds, still workable at spots like Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach. The day after, surf returns to 4ft @8s with a gentle 7 mph SSE breeze, keeping the fun alive at the same locations. Best: today.
