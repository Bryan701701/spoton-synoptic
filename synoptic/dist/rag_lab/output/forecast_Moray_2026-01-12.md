Today in Moray, it's a bit of a bummer with 3 ft @6s SSE swell and fresh 25 mph S wind making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 2 ft @8s ENE swell and lighter 11 mph SSW wind, but still not ideal—only Spey Bay and Lossiemouth showing some potential. Day after, the swell drops further to 2 ft @5s W with fresh 23 mph WSW wind, keeping it poor. Best: tomorrow.
