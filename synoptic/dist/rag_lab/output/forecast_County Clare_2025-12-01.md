County Clare is looking solid today with 5 ft @ 9s W swell and light 7 mph SSE winds. Doolin Point and Lahinch Beach are prime spots, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions take a turn with 13 ft @ 13s W swell and fresh 32 mph SSW winds, making it blown out and poor across the board. By the day after, things improve with 9 ft @ 12s W and lighter 11 mph W winds, offering better options at spots like Crab Island and Doolin Point. Best: today.
