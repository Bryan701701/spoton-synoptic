Today, all coasts are struggling with blown-out conditions due to fresh winds. North, South, and West are all reporting poor surf, with 7-10 ft swells but 22-34 mph onshore winds making it messy. Tomorrow sees a slight drop in swell size, but the wind remains fresh, keeping conditions challenging. The day after, surf drops further to 3-5 ft, still not producing much due to strong winds. Best: tomorrow.
