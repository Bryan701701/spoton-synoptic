Today, surf is on the quieter side with poor conditions across all coasts. North, South, and West are all experiencing fresh winds and off-angle swells, making it a day to give it a miss. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement in the South with 4 ft @ 8s WNW, but still not ideal. The day after drops to 3 ft @ 7s, remaining poor across the board. Best: tomorrow.
