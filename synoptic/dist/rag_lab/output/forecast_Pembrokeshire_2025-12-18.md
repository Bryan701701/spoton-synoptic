Today in Pembrokeshire, surf is looking fun at 4 ft @ 11s WSW with a moderate 13 mph SSW wind. Good spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are working well, especially on the mid-tide push. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 10 ft @ 11s WSW but with fresh 21 mph WSW winds, making it poor across the board. Day after, still poor with 5 ft @ 8s SW and 25 mph S winds. Best: today.
