Today in South Devon, Bantham is offering some fun with 2 ft @6s WSW and a moderate 12 mph W wind. It’s workable during the tide window from 08:13 to 16:30. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @9s WSW, but fresh 32 mph NW winds will make it blown out. Day after, Bantham picks up to 3 ft @9s WSW with lighter 10 mph WNW winds, making it a better bet. Best: today.
