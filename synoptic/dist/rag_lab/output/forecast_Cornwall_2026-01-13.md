Today, Cornwall is lighting up with solid surf! North spots like Crantock and Fistral are offering fun 4ft @ 10s W with light SSE winds, best early and mid-day. The South is also looking good, with Porthcurno and Praa Sands serving up 4ft @ 9s SW, clean and inviting. Over on the West, Sennen Cove and Gwenvor are peaking at 6ft @ 9s SW, perfect for those looking for a bit more power. Best: today.
