Today is a bit quiet with 2 ft @4s S swell and fresh 26 mph SW wind across the North East. Tomorrow drops to 1 ft @3s SSW, still with 10 mph SW wind, so not much happening. The day after sees a slight improvement with 2 ft @6s ESE at Saltburn Beach, but wind will be 18 mph S, making it a bit choppy. Best: day after.
