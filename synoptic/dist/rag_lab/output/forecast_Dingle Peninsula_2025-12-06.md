Today is flat with no surf on the Dingle Peninsula—wrong swell angle and calm conditions. Tomorrow sees a nice bump to 7 ft @10s WSW with a light 14 mph SW wind, making it workable at spots like Ballybunion Beach and Mossies during the mid-tide push. The day after, conditions drop slightly to 10 ft @11s WSW but remain poor with fresh 26 mph SW winds. Best: tomorrow.
