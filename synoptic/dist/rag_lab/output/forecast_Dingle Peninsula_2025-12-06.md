Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it's a no-go with flat conditions and no swell hitting the coast. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 7 ft @10s WSW swell, but fresh 14 mph SW winds will keep it choppy. Day after, the swell rises to 10 ft @11s WSW, but strong winds at 26 mph will make it messy. Best: tomorrow.
