Today in South Devon, conditions are poor with 10 ft @9s WSW swell and fresh 37 mph WSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow brings a better outlook with 5 ft @9s SW swell and lighter 11 mph SW winds, especially at Bantham from 08:01 to 16:12. The day after, expect 6 ft @9s SW swell with moderate 16 mph SW winds, still workable at spots like Bovisand Reef and Challborough. Best: tomorrow.
