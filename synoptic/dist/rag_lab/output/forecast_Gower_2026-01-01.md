Today in Gower, surf is on the small side at 2 ft @6s W with fresh 23 mph WNW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees similar conditions with 2 ft @5s W but winds pick up to 31 mph WNW, keeping it messy. The day after, conditions remain poor with 2 ft @5s NW and light 7 mph NNW winds, but still not producing. Best: today.
