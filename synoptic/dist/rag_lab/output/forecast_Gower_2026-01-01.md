Today on Gower, it’s a bit of a struggle with 2 ft @6s W swell and fresh 23 mph WNW winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with the same swell size but dropping to 5s and winds picking up to 31 mph, keeping it messy. The day after shows a slight improvement with the same swell size at 5s, but lightening winds at 7 mph NNW, making it a bit more manageable. Best: day after.
