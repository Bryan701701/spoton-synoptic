Today in Caithness, we have some fun options with 2ft @8s NE swell and light N winds at spots like Ackergill and Sinclair's Bay. The tide is best for Ackergill from 10:17 to 12:07, while Sinclair's Bay works well from 09:02 to 15:27. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 3ft @5s WNW swell and fresh 21 mph WNW winds, making it a blown-out day. The day after, things get wild with 6ft @6s NW swell and strong 36 mph NNW winds, so best to sit this one out. Best: today.
