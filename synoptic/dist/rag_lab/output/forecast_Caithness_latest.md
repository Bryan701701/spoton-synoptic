Today in Caithness, surf is looking fun with 3 ft @7s ESE swell and fresh 15 mph SSW winds. Ackergill, Sinclair's Bay, Keiss, and Freswick Bay are all working, with the best tides for Sinclair's Bay from 08:48 to 15:20. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 1 ft @5s ESE, so it’ll be a quiet day. Day after brings a solid 10 ft @10s W swell, but fresh 43 mph SW winds will make it blown out. Best: today.
