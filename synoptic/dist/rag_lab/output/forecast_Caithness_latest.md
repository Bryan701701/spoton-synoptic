Today in Caithness, surf is looking fun with 3 ft @ 8s ESE swell and light 9 mph SSW winds. Good spots like Ackergill and Sinclair's Bay are working well, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, expect a drop to 1 ft @ 6s, so it might be a good day to take a break. Day after brings back some energy at 4 ft @ 10s WNW, with light winds making it a solid pick. Best: today.
