Today in Caithness, it's looking great with solid 5 ft @ 13s NW swell and light 8 mph SW winds. Point of Ness and Murkle Point are your top picks, working best from 09:40 to 11:29 and again from 12:59 to 16:25. Tomorrow, conditions ease a bit with 4 ft @ 11s NW swell and fresh 17 mph SSE winds, but still some fun waves at spots like Dunnet Bay and Thurso East. By the day after, expect 3 ft @ 10s NNW swell with lighter 11 mph SE winds, making for a nice session at various spots. Best: today.
