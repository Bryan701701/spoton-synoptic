Today in Caithness, it’s looking great with 6 ft @14s W swell and light 5 mph S winds. Spots like Point of Ness and Murkle Point are firing, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions remain solid with the same swell height but a slight drop in period to 12s, and winds picking up to 12 mph SSW—still workable at sheltered spots. Day after, expect the swell to increase to 8 ft @10s W with lighter winds at 8 mph WSW, making it a fun day across the region. Best: day after.
