Today in Caithness, it's looking solid with 7 ft @ 12s W swell and 11 mph SSW winds. Point of Ness and Murkle Point are prime spots, especially during the mid-morning to early afternoon tides. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 5 ft @ 10s with fresh 30 mph S winds, making it poor across the board. Day after, the swell picks back up to 7 ft @ 15s, but still with fresh winds, so it’ll be a bit choppy. Best: today.
