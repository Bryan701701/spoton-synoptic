Today in Caithness, it's a bit of a mixed bag with 6 ft @9s NNW swell at spots like Point of Ness and Thurso East, but fresh 22 mph N winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 3 ft @8s NNW swell and 15 mph SSE winds, offering some workable options at places like Dunnet Bay and Murkle Point. By the day after, the swell holds at 4 ft @6s NNW, with lighter 12 mph ENE winds, making it a better day for a surf session. Best: day after.
