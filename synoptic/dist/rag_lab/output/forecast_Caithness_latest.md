Today in Caithness, it's a bit of a struggle with poor conditions: 3 ft @5s S swell and fresh 29 mph SSE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, similar story with 3 ft @8s SW swell and 21 mph SSW winds, still not producing much. However, day after brings some excitement with 7 ft @14s W swell and lighter 16 mph S winds, making it a workable day at spots like Point of Ness and Murkle Point. Best: day after.
