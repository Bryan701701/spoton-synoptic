Today in Caithness, it's looking fun with 3 ft @8s ESE swell and light 9 mph SSW winds. Ackergill and Sinclair's Bay are great spots to check out, especially with Sinclair's tides peaking from 08:57 to 15:41. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 5 ft @10s W with light winds, making Point of Ness and Murkle Point solid choices. The day after, expect 4 ft @10s WNW swell with similar light winds, keeping spots like Dunnet Bay and The Point in play. Best: tomorrow.
