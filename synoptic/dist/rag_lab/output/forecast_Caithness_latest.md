Today in Caithness, surf is looking solid with 6 ft @9s N swell and a light 12 mph N wind. Points like Point of Ness and Murkle Point are clean and working well, especially from 11:01 to 16:27. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @9s NE with fresh 27 mph SSE winds, making it less inviting. By the day after, we see a nice rebound to 6 ft @13s WNW with light 9 mph S winds, perfect for a fun session. Best: day after.
