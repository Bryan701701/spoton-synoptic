Today in Caithness, it's a tough call with 5 ft @ 6s SSE and fresh 40 mph SSE winds making for a blown-out scene. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 4 ft @ 7s SW, but the fresh 20 mph SSW winds will still keep it choppy. Day after, conditions improve significantly with 12 ft @ 12s NW and light 10 mph WSW winds, offering some solid surf at spots like Murkle Point. Best: day after.
