Today in Caithness, it's looking good with 6 ft @14s W swell and a fresh 17 mph SE wind. Best spots include Point of Ness and Murkle Point, both working well from 09:45 to 13:58 and again from 15:28 to 16:22. Tomorrow, conditions drop with poor surf at 4 ft @8s ESE and a strong 38 mph SE wind, making it a day to skip. Day after brings a slight improvement with 4 ft @8s E swell and lighter winds, but still not ideal. Best: today.
