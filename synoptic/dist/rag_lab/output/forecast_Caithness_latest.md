Today in Caithness, it's looking great with 4 ft @14s WNW swell and light 10 mph SSE winds. Point of Ness and Murkle Point are both firing, especially between 09:04 and 15:21. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 4 ft @11s WNW, but the wind lightens to just 2 mph SW, keeping things clean and fun. Day after, expect 3 ft @11s WNW with a gentle 7 mph SSE breeze, still offering good conditions at spots like Dunnet Bay and The Point. Best: today.
