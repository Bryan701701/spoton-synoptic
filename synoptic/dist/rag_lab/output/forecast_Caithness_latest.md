Today in Caithness, surf is on the smaller side with 1 ft @7s SW, and fresh 13 mph NNW winds making it a bit choppy. Tomorrow, conditions improve significantly with 4 ft @10s NNW swell and light 7 mph W winds, creating clean and fun waves at spots like Point of Ness and Thurso East. The day after continues the good vibes with similar 4 ft @9s NNW swell and light N winds, keeping the surf lively. Best: tomorrow.
