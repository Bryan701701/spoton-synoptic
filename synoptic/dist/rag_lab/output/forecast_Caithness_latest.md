Today in Caithness, it’s looking solid with 4ft @10s NW swell and light NNE winds at 9 mph. Great options at Point of Ness and Dunnet Bay, both offering clean conditions. Tomorrow, swell drops to 2ft @8s NE with NNW winds at 10 mph, still workable at spots like Point of Ness. Day after, conditions decline further with 2ft @6s NNW and fresh 25 mph WNW winds, making it a tough day for surf. Best: today.
