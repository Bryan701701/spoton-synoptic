Today in Caithness, it's a bit rough with fresh NNW winds at 42 mph creating blown-out conditions. The swell is 4 ft @ 6s from the NNE, but with the wind, it's not producing anything clean. Tomorrow sees a slight drop in swell to 3 ft @ 6s, but winds remain fresh at 25 mph NNW, keeping it messy. The day after, conditions improve with a solid 6 ft @ 9s from the NNW and lighter winds at 17 mph, making it a much better option. Best: day after.
