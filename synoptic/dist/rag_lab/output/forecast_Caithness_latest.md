Today in Caithness, it's a bit rough with 6 ft @ 8s NW swell and fresh 28 mph WNW winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a similar swell height at 14 ft @ 11s NNW, but with stronger 29 mph winds, keeping it messy. The day after drops to 11 ft @ 10s N with 27 mph N winds, still not ideal. Best: none.
