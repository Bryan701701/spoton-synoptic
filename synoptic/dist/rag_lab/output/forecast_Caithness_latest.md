Today in Caithness, it's a bit rough with 4 ft @7s NNE swell and fresh 21 mph NNE winds. No sheltered spots are working, so it’s best to give it a miss. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with 5 ft @6s NNE and stronger 30 mph NNE winds, keeping it blown out. The day after brings a slight drop to 3 ft @6s N with 32 mph NNW winds, still not ideal. Best: none.
