Today in Caithness, it's looking solid with 4 ft @ 14s WNW swell and light SSE winds at 10 mph. Point of Ness and Murkle Point are both firing, especially from 09:04 to 15:21. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 4 ft @ 11s WNW with light SW winds, making for a fun day at spots like Dunnet Bay and The Point. Day after, expect 3 ft @ 11s WNW, still clean but a touch smaller. Best: today.
