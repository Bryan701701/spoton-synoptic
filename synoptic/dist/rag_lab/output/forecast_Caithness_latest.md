Today in Caithness, it's looking great with 6 ft @ 9s W swell and light 10 mph SSW winds. Point of Ness and Murkle Point are firing, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell eases to 5 ft @ 14s NW with moderate 13 mph S winds, still offering some fun at the same spots. The day after holds similar conditions with 6 ft @ 12s WNW swell, keeping the surf lively. Best: today.
