Today in Caithness, Dunnet Bay is the standout with 3ft @11s WNW swell and light 8 mph S wind, making for clean conditions. Tomorrow sees a drop to 2ft @7s NW with fresh 15 mph NNE winds, but still some fun peaks at sheltered spots like Point of Ness. On the day after, expect a solid 4ft @10s NNW swell with light 7 mph WSW winds, lighting up several spots including Thurso East and Murkle Point. Best: day after.
