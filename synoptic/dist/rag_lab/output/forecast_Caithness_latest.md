Today in Caithness, it's looking solid with 4 ft @ 14s WNW swell and light SSE winds at 10 mph. Point of Ness and Murkle Point are your best bets, both working well from 09:04 to 15:21. Tomorrow, conditions remain fun with 4 ft @ 11s WNW and light SW winds, perfect for a session at spots like Dunnet Bay and The Point. Day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 11s WNW with SSE winds, still offering some rideable waves at sheltered spots. Best: today.
