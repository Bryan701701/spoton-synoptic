Today in Caithness, surf is looking good with 3 ft @ 8s ESE at spots like Ackergill and Sinclair's Bay, both working well under a moderate 11 mph WSW wind. Tomorrow, conditions drop a bit with 6 ft @ 8s WNW at the Point of Ness and similar spots, but expect fresh 12 mph SW winds making it a bit choppy. On the day after, surf remains at 3 ft @ 6s SE across the board, but the wind picks up to 21 mph SSW, leading to blown-out conditions. Best: today.
