Today in Caithness, it's looking good with 3 ft @10s WNW swell and a moderate 15 mph SSE wind. Sheltered corners like Point of Ness and Dunnet Bay are working well, offering clean conditions. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 3 ft @6s SSW swell and fresh 30 mph SSE winds, making it blown out and poor. The day after continues the trend with similar poor conditions. Best: today.
