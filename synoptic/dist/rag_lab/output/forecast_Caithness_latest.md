Today in Caithness, it’s a bit of a mixed bag. The swell is 6 ft @ 9s NNW at spots like Point of Ness and Thurso East, but the fresh 22 mph N wind is making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 3 ft @ 8s NNW and a lighter 15 mph SSE wind, making it more workable at places like Dunnet Bay. Day after, we see 4 ft @ 6s NNW with a gentle 12 mph ENE breeze, offering better options at several spots. Best: day after.
