Today in Caithness, it’s looking solid with 4ft @12s WNW swell and light 4 mph WSW winds. Point of Ness and Dunnet Bay are prime spots, both best from 09:04 to 15:22. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3ft @11s with SE winds at 9 mph; Dunnet Bay will still have some fun waves. Day after, conditions fade further with 3ft @7s NW swell and fresh NNE winds; it’s going to be a bit choppy. Best: today.
