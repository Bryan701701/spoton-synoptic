Today in Caithness, surf is on the smaller side with 2 ft @5s N and fresh 16 mph NNW winds. It's a bit messy, so best to give it a miss. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 3 ft @8s NNW and moderate 15 mph SSE winds, making it workable at spots like Point of Ness and Dunnet Bay. The day after, conditions remain decent with 4 ft @6s NNW and lighter 12 mph ENE winds, offering fun options at various breaks. Best: day after.
