Today in Caithness, it's a quiet scene with no surf; the swell isn't hitting this coast and the wind is fresh from the ESE at 38 mph. Tomorrow brings a nice change with 4 ft @ 8s E swell and light WNW winds at 5 mph, making for clean conditions at spots like Sinclair's Bay and Keiss. The day after, conditions drop to 2 ft @ 6s E with a moderate S wind, still workable but less exciting. Best: tomorrow.
