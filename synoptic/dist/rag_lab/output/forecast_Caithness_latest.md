Today in Caithness, it's looking great with 4 ft @ 12s WNW swell and light 4 mph WSW winds. Spots like Point of Ness and Dunnet Bay are firing, especially during the mid-tide windows from 09:04 to 15:22. Tomorrow, swell drops to 3 ft @ 11s with SE winds at 9 mph; Dunnet Bay remains the top pick. On the day after, conditions decline further with 3 ft @ 7s NW swell but fresh N winds at 18 mph will make it challenging. Best: today.
