Today in Caithness, surf is poor with 2 ft @6s SSE and fresh 21 mph SSW winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow sees a slight increase to 3 ft @5s SSE, but the 34 mph SSW winds will keep it messy. Day after brings a solid improvement with clean 4 ft @10s WNW surf and light 9 mph S winds at spots like Point of Ness and Murkle Point. Best: day after.
