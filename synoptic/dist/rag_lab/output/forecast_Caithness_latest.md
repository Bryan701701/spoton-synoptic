Today in Caithness, the surf is flat with no swell hitting the coast. Tomorrow, conditions improve as swell builds to 3 ft @7s ESE with light SSW winds, making for some clean options at spots like Sinclair's Bay and Ackergill. The day after, expect 4 ft @11s WNW with light SSE winds, offering fun waves at places like Point of Ness and Dunnet Bay. Best: tomorrow.
