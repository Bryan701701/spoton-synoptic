Today in Caithness, it's a quiet scene with no surf energy—flat at 0 ft and windless. Tomorrow, conditions improve as the swell picks up to 4 ft @ 8s with light 5 mph WNW winds, making for clean and fun waves at spots like Sinclair's Bay and Ackergill. The day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 6s with a fresh 16 mph S wind, keeping it mellow and less appealing. Best: tomorrow.
