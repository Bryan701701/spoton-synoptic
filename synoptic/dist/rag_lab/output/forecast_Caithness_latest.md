Today in Caithness, it's looking solid with 4 ft @10s NW swell and light NNE winds at 9 mph. Great options at Point of Ness and Dunnet Bay, both working well through the day. Tomorrow, expect a slight drop to 2 ft @8s NE with NNW winds at 10 mph—still some fun to be had at sheltered spots like Ackergill. By the day after, conditions take a downturn with 2 ft @6s NNW and fresh WNW winds at 25 mph, making it quite poor across the board. Best: today.
