Today in Caithness, Dunnet Bay is looking solid with 3 ft @ 12s W and a fresh 18 mph SE wind. It’s a great time to hit the water, especially between 08:51 and 15:19. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 5 ft @ 6s S and a strong 33 mph SSW wind, making it blown out and poor. The day after, swell picks up to 7 ft @ 9s W with a 19 mph SW wind, still not ideal. Best: today.
