Today in Caithness, conditions are poor with 8 ft @8s SE swell and fresh 43 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 2 ft @8s ESE swell and moderate 16 mph WSW winds, but still not producing much. The day after, expect 5 ft @9s WNW swell with light 13 mph WSW winds, offering some workable waves at spots like Point of Ness. Best: day after.
