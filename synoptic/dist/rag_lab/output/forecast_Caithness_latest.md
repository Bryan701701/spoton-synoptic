Today in Caithness, surf is looking solid with 4 ft @ 11s W swell and light 12 mph S winds. Point of Ness and Murkle Point are both clean and fun, perfect for catching some waves. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 5 ft @ 8s ESE swell and fresh 24 mph SSE winds, making it blown out and poor. The day after continues the trend with 3 ft @ 7s ESE and strong 29 mph S winds, keeping it messy. Best: today.
