Today in Caithness, it’s looking solid with 5 ft @ 13s NW swell and light 8 mph SW winds. Point of Ness and Murkle Point are both firing, especially during the tide windows from 09:40–11:29 and 12:59–16:25. Tomorrow, conditions ease a bit to 4 ft @ 11s NW with fresh 17 mph SSE winds, making it a mixed bag. The day after, expect 3 ft @ 10s NNW with lighter 11 mph SE winds, still fun at spots like Point of Ness. Best: today.
