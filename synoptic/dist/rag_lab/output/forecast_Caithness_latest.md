Today in Caithness, it's looking good with 4 ft @11s NNW swell and a moderate 17 mph SE wind. Sheltered spots like Point of Ness and Dunnet Bay are working well, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 4 ft @6s ESE swell and fresh 29 mph ESE winds, making it less appealing. The day after continues the trend with 7 ft @8s SE swell and strong 34 mph SE winds, likely blown out. Best: today.
