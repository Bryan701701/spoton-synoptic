Today in Caithness, it's a bit of a struggle with poor conditions. The swell is only 2 ft @ 6s from the SSE, and fresh 21 mph SSW winds are making it messy. Tomorrow, conditions worsen slightly with 3 ft @ 5s SSE and stronger 34 mph SSW winds, keeping it blown out. However, day after brings a solid improvement with 4 ft @ 10s WNW and light 9 mph S winds, making it a great day for surf at spots like Point of Ness and Murkle Point. Best: day after.
