Today in Caithness, it’s a bit of a rough ride with 5 ft @6s S swell and fresh 34 mph SSW winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, conditions improve significantly with a solid 7 ft @10s W swell and light 9 mph SSW winds, offering great opportunities at spots like Point of Ness and Murkle Point. The day after, we see a drop to 5 ft @14s NW with moderate 11 mph WSW winds, still providing fun waves at the same spots. Best: tomorrow.
