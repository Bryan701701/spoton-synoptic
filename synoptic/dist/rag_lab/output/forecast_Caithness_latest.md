Today in Caithness, we’re looking at solid conditions with 6 ft @14s W swell and a fresh 17 mph SE wind. Sheltered corners like Point of Ness and Murkle Point are working well, especially from 08:45 to 13:58. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 8 ft @8s ESE swell and a strong 38 mph SE wind, making it poor across the region. By the day after, we see a slight improvement with 4 ft @8s E swell and lighter winds, but still not ideal. Best: today.
