Today in Caithness, it's a bit rough with fresh SSE winds at 29 mph and 3 ft @ 5s S swell. Not producing well, so best to give it a miss. Tomorrow sees similar conditions with 3 ft @ 8s SW swell and 21 mph SSW winds, still not ideal. Day after, things improve with 7 ft @ 14s W swell and lighter 16 mph S winds, offering some solid options at spots like Point of Ness and Murkle Point. Best: day after.
