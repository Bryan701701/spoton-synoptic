Today in Caithness, it's a solid day with 7 ft @ 12s W swell and light 11 mph SSW winds. Point of Ness and Murkle Point are both lighting up, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 5 ft @ 10s with fresh 26 mph SSE winds, making it poor across the board. The day after, we see a return to 7 ft @ 15s W with lighter winds, offering a better chance for some fun waves. Best: today.
