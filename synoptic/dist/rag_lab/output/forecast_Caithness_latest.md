Today in Caithness, it's looking fun with 3 ft @ 8s N swell and light E winds at 10 mph. Good spots like Point of Ness and Dunnet Bay are clean and ready to ride. Tomorrow, the swell shifts slightly but remains at 3 ft @ 8s ESE, with similar light winds, keeping conditions workable at spots like Ackergill and Sinclair's Bay. By the day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 7s SE, but the light ESE winds should keep it tidy. Best: today.
