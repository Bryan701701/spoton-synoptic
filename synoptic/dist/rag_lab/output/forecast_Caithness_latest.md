Today in Caithness, conditions are poor with 3 ft @5s S swell and fresh 29 mph SSE winds. Tomorrow remains similar, with 3 ft @8s SW and 21 mph SSW winds, so not much improvement. Day after, things start to pick up with 7 ft @14s W swell, but fresh 31 mph SSW winds will make it challenging. Best: day after.
