Today on the West Coast, surf is looking fun with 5 ft @12s WNW at spots like Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay, despite a fresh 14 mph E wind. It’s clean early, but expect some chop as the day progresses. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @10s, still offering good conditions at the same spots. The day after, it eases further to 2 ft @10s, but remains workable at sheltered corners. Best: today.
