Today on the Dingle Peninsula, conditions are poor with an off-angle swell at 8 ft @ 9s from the WSW and fresh 20 mph SSW winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow, similar conditions persist with the same swell height and direction but stronger winds at 27 mph from the N, keeping it messy. The day after sees a slight drop to 7 ft @ 9s with 26 mph SSW winds, still not ideal. Best: none.
