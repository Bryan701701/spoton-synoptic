Dingle Peninsula is looking solid today with 11 ft @ 12s W swell and a moderate 14 mph W wind. Ballybunion Left and Garywilliam Point are your best bets early, while Mossies offers a longer window throughout the day. Tomorrow sees a drop to 10 ft @ 10s W with fresh 23 mph W wind, making it less appealing. The day after, conditions worsen with 11 ft @ 11s WSW and a strong 47 mph SSE wind, likely making it blown out. Best: today.
