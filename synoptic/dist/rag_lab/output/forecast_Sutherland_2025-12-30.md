Sutherland is lighting up today with 5 ft @12s N swell and light 7 mph N winds. Great conditions at spots like Melvich and Strathy, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, Sango Bay remains the standout with 5 ft @8s NNW, but watch for fresh 22 mph W winds making it a bit choppy. The day after brings a hefty 13 ft @11s NNW swell, but strong 39 mph NNW winds will have it blown out. Best: today.
