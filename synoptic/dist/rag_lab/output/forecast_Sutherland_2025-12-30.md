Sutherland is looking solid today with 5 ft @12s N swell and light 7 mph N winds. Good spots like Melvich and Strathy are working well, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, expect a shift as Sango Bay remains the standout with 5 ft @8s NNW swell, but fresh 22 mph W winds will make it a bit choppy. The day after, conditions drop significantly with 13 ft @11s NNW swell but strong 39 mph NNW winds will make it poor across the board. Best: today.
