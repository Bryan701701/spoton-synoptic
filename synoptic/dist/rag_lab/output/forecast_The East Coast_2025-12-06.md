Today on the East Coast, conditions are poor with a hefty 7 ft @8s SE swell and fresh 28 mph SE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the surf improves to 3 ft @7s E with light 3 mph NNW winds, offering a clean and fun session at spots like St Andrews East. The day after, it drops to 2 ft @6s E with similar light winds, still workable but mellow. Best: tomorrow.
