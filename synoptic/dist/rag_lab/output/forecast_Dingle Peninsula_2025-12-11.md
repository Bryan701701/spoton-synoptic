Today on the Dingle Peninsula, conditions are poor with a hefty swell of 12 ft @10s from the SW and fresh 40 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell increases to 14 ft @14s but remains messy with 29 mph SSW winds. The day after, the swell drops to 11 ft @12s, still with fresh 34 mph SSW winds, keeping it challenging. Best: tomorrow.
