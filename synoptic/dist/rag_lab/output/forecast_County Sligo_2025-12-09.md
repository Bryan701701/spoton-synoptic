Today in County Sligo, it's looking poor with 3 ft @10s WNW swell, but fresh 22 mph SE winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 6 ft @9s WNW, but with 20 mph SW winds, it's still not ideal. Day after, the swell drops slightly to 5 ft @9s W, with fresh 25 mph S winds continuing to create challenging conditions. Best: tomorrow.
