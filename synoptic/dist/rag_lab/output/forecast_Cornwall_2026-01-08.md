Today, Cornwall is lighting up with clean surf! North spots like Crantock and Fistral are offering fun 5ft @ 7s W with a light 12 mph WNW wind, best enjoyed between 08:43 and 16:35. The South is also looking good, with Porthcurno and Praa Sands serving up 3ft @ 6s W, thanks to light winds. Over on the West, Sennen Cove and Gwenvor are providing 4ft @ 7s W, perfect for a solid session. Tomorrow, expect a drop in conditions across the board, with winds picking up. Day after, it’s looking poor everywhere. Best: today!
