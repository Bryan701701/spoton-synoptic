North Devon is looking solid today with 3 ft @10s WSW swell and light 8 mph SSE winds. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are great picks, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @10s, but Woolacombe and Putsborough will still have some fun, clean conditions with 6 mph ESE winds. Day after, we see a slight bump back to 3 ft @9s, with similar light winds, keeping spots like Woolacombe and Croyde Beach lively. Best: today.
