Today, Gower is seeing some sizable surf at 6 ft @11s WSW, but with a fresh 18 mph ESE wind, it's blown out and not producing. Tomorrow, the swell increases to 7 ft @8s WSW, but the same wind conditions will keep it messy. By the day after, the swell peaks at 9 ft @10s SW, yet the strong 35 mph S wind will make it challenging. Best: none.
