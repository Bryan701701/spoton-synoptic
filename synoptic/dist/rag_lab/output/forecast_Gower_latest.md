Today in Gower, it's a great day for surfing with solid 5ft @12s WSW swell and light ESE winds at 9 mph. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are your top picks, both working well throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3ft @10s WSW with fresh 19 mph E winds, making it poor across the board. By the day after, expect 2ft @7s SW with 16 mph E winds; still workable at spots like Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach. Best: today.
