Today on Gower, conditions are poor with 3 ft @5s ENE swell and fresh 19 mph NE winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 2 ft @5s ESE with lighter 8 mph ENE winds, but it remains uninviting. The day after, swell picks back up to 3 ft @5s E, but with fresh 13 mph ENE winds, it’s still not looking great. Best: none.
