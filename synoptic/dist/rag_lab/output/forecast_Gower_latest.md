Today, Gower is seeing 3 ft @ 5s ENE swell with fresh 19 mph NE winds, making for blown-out conditions across the board. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 5s ESE with lighter 8 mph ENE winds, but still not producing much. Day after, we’re back to 3 ft @ 5s E with moderate 13 mph ENE winds, maintaining the less-than-ideal state. Best: day after.
