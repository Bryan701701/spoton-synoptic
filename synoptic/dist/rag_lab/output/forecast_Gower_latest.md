Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are your best bets, with optimal tides from 08:18–08:47 and all day until 16:07 respectively. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 4ft @9s WSW swell and fresh 26 mph S winds, making it poor across the board. On the day after, expect a boost to 6ft @12s WSW with lighter 12 mph S winds, keeping spots like Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach in play. Best: today.
