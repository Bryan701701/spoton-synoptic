Today in Gower, it’s a quiet one with 1 ft @ 5s W and fresh 14 mph WNW winds. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 4 ft @ 6s WNW, but the fresh 28 mph NW wind will make it blown out. By the day after, conditions improve slightly with 3 ft @ 7s W and lighter winds at 13 mph WNW, making it more workable at spots like Llangennith Beach. Best: day after.
