Today in Gower, surf is on the smaller side at 2 ft @9s SSW, but fresh 23 mph ENE wind is making it messy across the board. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 1 ft @12s WSW and light 6 mph ESE winds, making Llangennith Beach and Oxwich Bay the best bets for some fun, albeit small, surf. Day after, the swell picks up to 2 ft @5s W, but fresh 18 mph WNW winds will likely keep it choppy. Best: tomorrow.
