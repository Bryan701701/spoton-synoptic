Today in Gower, it's a no-go with 10 ft @10s SW swell and fresh 35 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 8 ft @10s WSW, but the fresh 21 mph SW wind keeps it messy. By the day after, the swell continues to decrease to 6 ft @10s WSW, with the same wind conditions persisting. Best: tomorrow.
