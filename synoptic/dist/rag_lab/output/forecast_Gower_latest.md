Today on Gower, it's looking poor with 6 ft @8s WSW swell, but fresh 21 mph SW winds are making it messy. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 8 ft @9s, but the wind ramps up to a strong 35 mph from the S, keeping conditions challenging. Day after, similar swell at 8 ft @10s with 23 mph SW winds, still not ideal. Best: day after.
