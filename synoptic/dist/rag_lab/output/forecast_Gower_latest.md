Today in Gower, conditions are poor with 5 ft @9s WSW swell and fresh 21 mph S winds. It's blown out across the board, so best to skip it. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 5 ft @11s WSW and 16 mph S winds, offering workable conditions at spots like Llangennith Beach during the mid-tide push. The day after brings a bigger swell at 9 ft @10s WSW, but with fresh 23 mph WSW winds, it’s likely to be messy again. Best: tomorrow.
