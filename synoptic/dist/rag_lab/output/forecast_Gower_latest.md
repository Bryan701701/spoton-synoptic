Today in Gower, surf is rolling in at 7 ft @ 9s WSW with fresh 18 mph SSW winds. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are your best bets, offering clean conditions during the tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @ 9s with moderate 14 mph SE winds, still workable at the same spots. By the day after, expect a further drop to 3 ft @ 9s, but with light 9 mph WNW winds, making for fun, clean surf. Best: today.
