Today in Gower, it's a bit of a bummer with 6 ft @10s WSW swell but fresh 27 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, things turn around with 7 ft @13s WSW swell and light 5 mph W winds, offering clean conditions at spots like Llangennith Beach and Broughton Bay. The day after, the swell drops to 6 ft @11s WSW with moderate 17 mph SW winds, making it workable but not as pristine. Best: tomorrow.
