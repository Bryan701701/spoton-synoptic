Today in Gower, surf is looking fun with 4 ft @ 7s W and a moderate 12 mph WNW wind. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are your go-to spots, especially during the best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 5 ft @ 8s W but fresh 27 mph NW winds will make it blown out and poor across the board. Day after, things improve with 5 ft @ 10s W and light 8 mph NW winds, creating cleaner conditions at the same good spots. Best: day after.
