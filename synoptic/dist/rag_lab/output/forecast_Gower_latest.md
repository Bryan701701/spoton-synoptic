Today on Gower, conditions are poor with 5 ft @9s WSW swell and fresh 21 mph S winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 5 ft @11s WSW swell and 16 mph S winds, making it workable at spots like Llangennith Beach during the mid-tide push. The day after, expect 9 ft @10s WSW swell but with fresh 23 mph WSW winds, leading to messy conditions again. Best: tomorrow.
