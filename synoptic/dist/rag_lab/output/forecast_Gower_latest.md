Gower is lighting up today with solid 7 ft @ 12s WSW swell and light NW winds at 11 mph. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are your top picks, both working well from 08:14 to 16:07. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 6 ft @ 12s with fresh SW winds at 17 mph, but still some fun to be had at the same spots. Day after, conditions worsen with 7 ft @ 8s and strong SSW winds at 23 mph, making it poor across the board. Best: today.
