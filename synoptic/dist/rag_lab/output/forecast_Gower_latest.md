Today in Gower, conditions are poor with a swell of 3 ft @ 5s from the E and fresh 24 mph E winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow sees a drop to 1 ft @ 6s SE with even stronger 31 mph E winds, making it a day to give a miss. The day after brings back the 3 ft @ 5s E swell with lighter 13 mph ENE winds, but still not ideal. Best: day after.
