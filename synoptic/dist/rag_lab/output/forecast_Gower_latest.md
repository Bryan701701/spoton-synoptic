Today, Gower is looking good with 4ft @9s WSW swell and fresh 14 mph SW winds. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are both working well, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 13ft @11s WSW swell and strong 28 mph WSW winds, making it poor across the board. By the day after, things improve with 6ft @12s WSW swell and light 10 mph ESE winds, creating a fun surf day at spots like Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach. Best: day after.
