Today in Gower, it's a bit of a bummer with fresh 27 mph S winds on 6 ft @10s WSW swell, making it blown out across the board—give it a miss. Tomorrow, things turn around with 7 ft @13s WSW swell and light 5 mph W winds, offering clean conditions at spots like Llangennith Beach and Broughton Bay. The day after, expect 6 ft @11s WSW swell with moderate 17 mph SW winds, still workable at some corners. Best: tomorrow.
