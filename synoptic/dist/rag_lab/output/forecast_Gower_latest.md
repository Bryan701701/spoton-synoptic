Today on Gower, it's looking good with 5 ft @ 8s WSW swell and 13 mph NNW winds. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are your best bets, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow brings cleaner conditions with 5 ft @ 10s WSW swell and lighter 7 mph SW winds, making it a prime day for all spots. The day after, however, is set to be blown out with 11 ft @ 11s WSW swell and fresh 27 mph SW winds. Best: tomorrow.
