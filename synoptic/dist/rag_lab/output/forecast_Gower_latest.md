Today, Gower is seeing 2 ft @ 6s W with fresh 23 mph WNW wind, making it blown out and messy across the board. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with similar 2 ft @ 5s W swell but stronger 31 mph WNW winds, keeping it poor. On the day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 5s NW with lighter 7 mph NNW winds, but it remains uninviting. Best: today.
