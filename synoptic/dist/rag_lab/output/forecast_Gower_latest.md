Today on Gower, it's a bit of a bummer with 6 ft @8s SW swell, but fresh 19 mph S winds are making it blown out across the board—no spots are working. Tomorrow brings a nice change with 4 ft @12s WSW and light 6 mph N winds; expect some fun conditions at places like Llangennith Beach and Boiler Reef during the mid-tide windows. Day after, the swell drops slightly to 5 ft @9s WSW, but fresh 20 mph S winds will keep things messy again. Best: tomorrow.
