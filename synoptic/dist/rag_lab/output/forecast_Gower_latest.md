Today in Gower, the surf is 4 ft @ 6s SW with fresh 27 mph SSE winds making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees an increase to 8 ft @ 9s WSW, but with 19 mph SSW winds, conditions remain poor. Day after brings a solid 5 ft @ 10s WSW with lighter 12 mph SE winds, creating a much better surf day. Best: day after.
