Today on Gower, it's looking solid with 4ft @12s W swell and fresh 15 mph NNW winds. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are your go-to spots, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 4ft @9s WSW swell and fresh 26 mph S winds, making it blown out and poor. By the day after, we see a nice jump to 6ft @12s WSW with lighter 12 mph S winds, so expect some fun waves at spots like Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach. Best: day after.
