Gower is looking solid today with 6 ft @8s WSW swell and fresh 16 mph SW winds. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are your best bets, both offering fun conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop as the swell remains but winds pick up to 22 mph SSW, making it poor across the board. Day after, expect a nice rebound with 6 ft @9s WSW and lighter 12 mph W winds, perfect for a surf session at spots like Broughton Bay or Llangennith Beach. Best: day after.
