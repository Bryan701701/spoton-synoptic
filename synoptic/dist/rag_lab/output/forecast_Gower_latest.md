Today in Gower, it's looking poor with 7 ft @ 8s WSW swell and fresh 28 mph SSW winds. All spots are blown out, so it’s best to give it a miss. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 7 ft @ 9s WSW swell and lighter 14 mph S winds, making for some workable corners at places like Llangennith Beach. By the day after, we see a nice drop to 4 ft @ 12s WSW with light 9 mph NNW winds, creating clean conditions at several spots. Best: day after.
