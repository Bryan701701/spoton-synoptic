Today, Gower is seeing 3 ft @5s E swell with fresh 9 mph NE wind, making it a bit messy across the board. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2 ft @6s ESE with stronger 25 mph E winds, leading to blown-out surf. Day after, Llangennith Beach and Oxwich Bay light up with 1 ft @11s WSW, offering a fun, clean window. Best: day after.
