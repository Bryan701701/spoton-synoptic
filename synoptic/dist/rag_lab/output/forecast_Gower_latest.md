Today on Gower, it's looking pretty quiet with 2 ft @6s SE swell and fresh 8 mph NE winds. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with the same 2 ft @5s ENE swell but ramping up to a fresh 26 mph NE wind, making it blown out. Day after, the swell drops to 1 ft @5s ESE, still not much to work with. Best: today.
