Today, Gower is seeing poor conditions with a hefty 9 ft @10s WSW swell, but fresh 21 mph WSW winds are making it blown out everywhere. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 5 ft @8s SW, still with fresh 23 mph SSE winds, keeping it messy across the board. On the day after, conditions improve significantly with 6 ft @12s WSW swell and lighter 11 mph SE winds, making for a much cleaner surf day. Best: day after.
