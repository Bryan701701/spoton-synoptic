Today in Gower, surf is pumping at 7 ft @ 9s WSW with fresh 18 mph SSW winds. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are both clean and working well, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @ 9s WSW with moderate 14 mph SE winds, still offering some fun at the same spots. By the day after, conditions improve further with 3 ft @ 9s WSW and light 9 mph WNW winds, making it a great day for a surf session. Best: today.
