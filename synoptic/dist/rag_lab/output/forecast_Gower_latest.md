Today in Gower, surf is poor with 2 ft @9s SSW and fresh 23 mph ENE winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow, Llangennith Beach and Oxwich Bay show some promise with 1 ft @12s WSW and light 6 mph ESE winds, making for a cleaner day. However, the day after brings back 2 ft @5s W swell with fresh 18 mph WNW winds, leading to another blown-out scenario. Best: tomorrow.
