Today, Gower is looking solid with 6 ft @8s WSW swell and fresh 16 mph SW winds. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are your best bets, with good tides from mid-morning to late afternoon. Tomorrow, conditions drop to poor with the same swell but stronger 22 mph SSW winds, making it a day to skip. Day after shows improvement with 6 ft @9s WSW and lighter 12 mph W winds, so expect fun surf at spots like Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach. Best: day after.
