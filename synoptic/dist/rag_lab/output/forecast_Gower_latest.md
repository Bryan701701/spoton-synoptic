Today, Gower is looking fun with 4ft @9s WSW swell and fresh 14 mph SW winds. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are your best bets, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions take a turn for the worse with 13ft @11s WSW swell and strong 28 mph WSW winds — best to steer clear. Day after brings a solid 6ft @12s WSW swell with light 10 mph ESE winds, making for a great surf day at spots like Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach. Best: day after.
