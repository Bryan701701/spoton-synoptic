Today, Gower is quiet with no surf, as the swell isn't hitting this coast. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 5 ft @11s WSW, but fresh ESE winds will keep it messy. Day after, we see a better setup with 6 ft @8s SW, light winds, and workable tides at spots like Llangennith Beach. Best: day after.
