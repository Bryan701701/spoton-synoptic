Today in Gower, surf is on at 6 ft @ 8s WSW with fresh 16 mph SW winds. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are your best bets, both offering workable conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop to poor with 6 ft @ 11s WSW and fresh 22 mph SSW winds, so it’s a miss. Day after looks promising again with 6 ft @ 9s WSW and lighter 12 mph W winds, making for a fun surf day. Best: day after.
