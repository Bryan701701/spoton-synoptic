Today on Gower, it's a bit of a bummer with 6 ft @8s SW swell but fresh 19 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow brings a nice change with 4 ft @12s WSW and light 6 mph N winds, making for clean conditions at spots like Llangennith Beach. Day after, the swell holds at 5 ft @9s WSW but fresh 20 mph S winds will keep it messy. Best: tomorrow.
