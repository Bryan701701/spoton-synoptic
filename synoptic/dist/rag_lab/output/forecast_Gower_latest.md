Today on Gower, Llangennith Beach and Oxwich Bay are both working with 1ft @ 12s WSW and light 7 mph NE winds. It’s a great day for a mellow session, especially at Llangennith during the mid-tide window. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2ft @ 5s WNW with fresh 19 mph WNW winds, making it a poor day for surf. The day after looks similar with 2ft @ 5s W and 21 mph WNW winds, so best to hold off. Best: today.
