Gower is looking good today with 4ft @9s WSW swell and fresh 14 mph SW winds. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are your top picks, both offering fun waves throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions take a turn with 13ft @11s WSW swell and strong 28 mph WSW winds, making it poor across the board. By the day after, things improve to 6ft @12s WSW with lighter 10 mph ESE winds, making it a great day for Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach again. Best: day after.
