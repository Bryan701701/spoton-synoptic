Today in Gower, conditions are poor with 5 ft @8s W swell, but fresh 27 mph NW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow looks much better as the swell drops to 4 ft @10s WSW with light 9 mph NNE winds, creating clean conditions at spots like Llangennith Beach and Broughton Bay. The day after, the swell decreases further to 3 ft @7s SW with fresh 22 mph SE winds, keeping conditions poor again. Best: tomorrow.
