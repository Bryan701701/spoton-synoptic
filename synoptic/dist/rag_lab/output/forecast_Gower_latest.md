Today in Gower, it's a bit of a struggle with 5 ft @6s WNW swell and fresh 29 mph NW winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 3 ft @7s WSW swell and lighter 11 mph WNW winds, bringing some clean options at spots like Llangennith Beach and Broughton Bay. Day after, the swell picks up to 6 ft @8s W but fresh 23 mph NW winds will keep it messy again. Best: tomorrow.
