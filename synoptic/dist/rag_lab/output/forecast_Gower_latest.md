Today in Gower, it’s looking good with 5 ft @10s WSW swell and a moderate 13 mph NNW wind. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are your top picks, both working well throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 4 ft @6s SW swell and fresh 26 mph SSE winds, making it poor across the board. Day after, the swell picks up to 8 ft @9s WSW but remains blown out with the same strong winds. Best: today.
