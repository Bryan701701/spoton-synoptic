Today in Gower, it's looking good with 6 ft @8s WSW swell and fresh 16 mph SW winds. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are your top picks, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop as the swell stays the same but winds pick up to 22 mph SSW, making it poor across the board. Day after brings a return to form with 6 ft @9s WSW and lighter 12 mph W winds, ideal for a fun session at spots like Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach. Best: day after.
