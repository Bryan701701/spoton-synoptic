Today in Gower, conditions are poor with a fresh NW wind at 29 mph and 5 ft @ 6s WNW swell. It's a bit blown out, so best to give it a miss. Tomorrow, things improve with 3 ft @ 7s WSW swell and a lighter 11 mph WNW wind, making for cleaner surf at spots like Llangennith Beach. The day after, swell picks up to 6 ft @ 8s W but remains poor due to fresh NW winds. Best: tomorrow.
