Today in Gower, conditions are poor with a hefty 9 ft @10s WSW swell, but fresh 21 mph WSW winds are making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 5 ft @8s SW, with winds picking up to 23 mph SSE, keeping it messy. Day after brings a nice improvement with 6 ft @12s WSW and lighter 11 mph SE winds, making it a great day to hit spots like Llangennith Beach. Best: day after.
