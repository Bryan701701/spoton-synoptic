Today in Gower, it's a bit of a struggle with 6 ft @11s WSW swell and fresh 18 mph ESE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight increase to 7 ft @8s WSW, but the same fresh 18 mph SSW winds will keep it messy. On day three, conditions worsen with 9 ft @10s SW swell and strong 35 mph S winds, making it quite challenging. Best: today.
