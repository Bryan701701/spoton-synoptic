Today in Gower, surf is looking fun at 3 ft @ 11s WSW with light 4 mph S winds. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are your best bets, offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, expect a solid bump to 5 ft @ 9s WSW with a light SSW breeze, making for some lively surf at spots like Horton and Caswell Bay. Day after, fresh 21 mph S winds will blow out the 5 ft @ 11s WSW swell, so it’s best to skip it. Best: tomorrow.
