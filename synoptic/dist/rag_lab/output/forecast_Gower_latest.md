Today in Gower, it's looking solid with 5 ft @10s WSW swell and a moderate 13 mph NNW wind. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are your best bets, both offering fun conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @6s SW with fresh 26 mph SSE winds, making it poor across the board. The day after, swell picks up to 8 ft @9s WSW, but strong 26 mph SSW winds will keep it blown out. Best: today.
