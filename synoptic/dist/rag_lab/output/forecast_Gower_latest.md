Today in Gower, it's looking solid with 6 ft @8s WSW swell and fresh 16 mph SW winds. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are your best bets, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to poor with strong 22 mph SSW winds, making it a day to skip. By the day after, we see a nice improvement with 6 ft @9s WSW swell and lighter 12 mph W winds, perfect for a surf session at spots like Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach. Best: day after.
