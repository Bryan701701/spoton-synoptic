Today, Gower is seeing 3 ft @7s S with a light 10 mph E wind. It's a bit choppy, so best to give it a miss. Tomorrow, similar conditions with 3 ft @6s E and a light 7 mph NNE wind, still not producing much. Day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @5s ENE with a fresh 14 mph NE wind, making it blown out. Best: none.
