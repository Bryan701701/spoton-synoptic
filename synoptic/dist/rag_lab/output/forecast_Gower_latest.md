Today in Gower, it's a tough call with 8 ft @10s WSW swell and fresh 27 mph SW winds making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 6 ft @10s WSW and lighter 14 mph S winds, offering some workable conditions at spots like Llangennith Beach and Broughton Bay. By the day after, conditions get even better with 5 ft @12s WSW and light 9 mph NW winds, making it a great day to hit the surf. Best: day after.
