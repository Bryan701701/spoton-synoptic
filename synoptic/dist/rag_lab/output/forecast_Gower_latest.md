Today on Gower, conditions are poor with 5 ft @9s WSW swell and fresh 21 mph S winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 5 ft @11s WSW swell and 16 mph S winds, offering some workable windows, especially around mid-tide. The day after brings a stronger swell at 9 ft @10s WSW, but fresh 23 mph WSW winds will keep it messy. Best: tomorrow.
