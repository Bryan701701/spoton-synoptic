Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a solid 7 ft @ 12s WSW with light ESE winds, making for clean conditions at spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 10s, still with light E winds, keeping it fun at the same spots. By the day after, the surf fades further to 2 ft @ 7s, with only St Brides Bay and Tenby offering some rideable waves. Best: today.
