Today in South Devon, it's looking good with 5 ft @8s SW swell and fresh 13 mph SSW winds. Bovisand Reef and Challborough are both clean and fun, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 4 ft @9s with moderate 14 mph NW winds, still workable at the same spots. On the day after, conditions ease with 3 ft @8s and light 5 mph ENE winds at Bantham, making it the best pick. Best: today.
