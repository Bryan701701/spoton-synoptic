Today in Northwest Wales, conditions are poor with a swell of 5 ft @ 7s SW and fresh 18 mph S winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow, we see an improvement with 4 ft @ 7s WSW, lightening winds at 11 mph SW, making for some clean options at spots like Porth Oer and Hells Mouth. The day after continues the trend with 3 ft @ 8s WSW and light 8 mph SSE winds, still offering some fun waves at sheltered corners. Best: tomorrow.
