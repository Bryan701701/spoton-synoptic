Today in County Sligo, it's looking solid with 7 ft @16s WNW swell and a moderate 13 mph S wind. Strandhill and Easkey spots are your best bets, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @12s WNW, but with light 4 mph N winds, it should be clean and fun at Strandhill and Easkey. Day after, expect 3 ft @12s WNW with similar light winds, still workable at Strandhill. Best: today.
