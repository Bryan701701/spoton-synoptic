Today in County Sligo, it's looking good with 7 ft @ 16s WNW swell and 13 mph S winds. Strandhill and Easkey spots are working well, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @ 12s with light N winds, making for a clean session at Strandhill and Easkey. The day after, expect 3 ft @ 12s with SSE winds; Strandhill remains the top pick. Best: today.
