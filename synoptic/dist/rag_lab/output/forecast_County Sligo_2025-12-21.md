Today in County Sligo, it's looking fun with 7 ft @16s WNW swell and 13 mph S winds. Strandhill and Easkey spots are working well, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @12s WNW with light 4 mph N winds, making for cleaner conditions at Strandhill and Easkey. The day after, expect 3 ft @12s WNW with light SSE winds, still offering some fun at Strandhill. Best: tomorrow.
