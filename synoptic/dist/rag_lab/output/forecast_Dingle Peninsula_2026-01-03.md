Today on the Dingle Peninsula, surf is looking fun with 6 ft @9s N swell and fresh 17 mph NE winds. Ballybunion Right and Ballybunion Beach are your best bets, especially during the early and mid-day tides. Tomorrow, conditions improve with a cleaner 4 ft @10s NNW swell and light 7 mph N winds, making it a great day to hit the water. Day after, expect 4 ft @7s NNW but fresh 26 mph N winds will make it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
