Today in the North East, it's a fun 2 ft @ 8s NNE with fresh 17 mph W winds. Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands are your best bets, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @ 6s NNW with strong 35 mph NW winds, making it blown out across the region. The day after, expect a solid 3 ft @ 8s NE with light 9 mph S winds, perfect for a surf session at Saltburn Beach or Roker Pier. Best: day after.
