Today on the West Coast, it's a bit rough with 6 ft @12s WNW swell but fresh 19 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, expect a drop to 5 ft @6s S with even stronger 34 mph S winds, keeping it messy. The day after, conditions remain poor with 6 ft @9s WSW swell and 32 mph SSW winds, still not ideal. Best: today.
