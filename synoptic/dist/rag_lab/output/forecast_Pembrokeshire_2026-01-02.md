Today in Pembrokeshire, conditions are poor with 3 ft @5s NW swell and fresh 15 mph NW winds across all spots. Tomorrow, the same 3 ft @5s NW swell continues, but winds pick up to 21 mph NNW, making it blown out. Day after sees a drop to 2 ft @6s WNW with 17 mph NNW winds, still not producing. Best: today.
