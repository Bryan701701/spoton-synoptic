Today on the East Coast, Aberdeen Harbour is showing some potential with 3 ft @ 6s NNE and fresh 15 mph NNW winds. It's a bit choppy, but sheltered corners should be workable, especially during the tide window from 09:21 to 16:32. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @ 6s SSE with stronger 23 mph S winds, leading to blown-out surf. The day after, things improve with 3 ft @ 7s SE and lighter 8 mph SSW winds, making it a great day for a session at spots like Aberdeen Beach or Cruden Bay. Best: day after.
