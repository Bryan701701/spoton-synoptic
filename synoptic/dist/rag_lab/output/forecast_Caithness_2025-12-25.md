Today in Caithness, it's a solid 4 ft @ 12s WNW with light 4 mph WSW winds, making for clean conditions at spots like Point of Ness and Dunnet Bay. Tomorrow, we see a slight drop to 3 ft @ 11s with a shift to 9 mph SE winds; still workable at Dunnet Bay. By the day after, conditions drop further to 3 ft @ 7s with fresh 18 mph NNE winds, leading to a blown-out situation. Best: today.
