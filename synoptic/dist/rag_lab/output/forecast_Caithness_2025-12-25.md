Today in Caithness, it’s looking solid with 4 ft @ 12s WNW swell and light 4 mph WSW winds. Best spots are Point of Ness and Dunnet Bay, both working well from 09:04 to 15:22. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 3 ft @ 11s WNW with 9 mph SE winds, still decent at Dunnet Bay. Day after, conditions fade with 3 ft @ 7s NW and fresh 18 mph NNE winds, making it less inviting. Best: today.
