Today on the West Coast, it’s a bit rough with 7 ft @12s W and fresh 34 mph ESE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 5 ft @12s W, but the fresh ENE wind continues to keep things messy. By the day after, conditions improve with 3 ft @10s W, offering some workable waves at spots like Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay, especially during the tide windows. Best: day after.
