Today in County Clare, it's a tough call with 7 ft @9s WSW swell but fresh 21 mph SSW wind making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 4 ft @9s W swell and 17 mph N wind, offering some workable waves at spots like Doolin Point and Lahinch Beach. The day after, swell picks up to 5 ft @8s W but with 18 mph S wind, keeping it messy. Best: tomorrow.
