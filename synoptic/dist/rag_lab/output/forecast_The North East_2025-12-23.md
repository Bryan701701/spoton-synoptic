Today in the North East, it's looking solid with 3 ft @ 6s E swell and a moderate 11 mph ESE wind. Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach are prime spots, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with the same swell and wind, keeping the surf fun and consistent. By the day after, the swell drops slightly to 3 ft @ 5s, but the wind picks up to 16 mph, adding some chop. Best: today.
