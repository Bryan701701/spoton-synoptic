Today in Caithness, it's a no-go with poor conditions: 7 ft @7s SE swell and fresh 47 mph SSE winds. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 6 ft @8s SE, but the fresh 36 mph SSW wind keeps it messy. Day after, things improve with a solid 12 ft @12s NW swell and light 10 mph WSW winds, making it the best day to hit the water. Best: day after.
