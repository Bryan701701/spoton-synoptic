Today in Caithness, it's a bit of a washout with fresh SSE winds at 47 mph and 7 ft @ 7s SE swell, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees a slight drop in swell to 6 ft @ 8s SE, but the fresh SSW winds at 36 mph will keep conditions poor. Day after, we finally see some improvement with 12 ft @ 12s NW swell and light WSW winds at 10 mph, making it a solid day at spots like Murkle Point. Best: day after.
