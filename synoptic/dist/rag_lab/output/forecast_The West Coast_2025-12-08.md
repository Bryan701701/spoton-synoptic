Today on the West Coast, it’s a bit rough with 4 ft @8s WSW swell and fresh 23 mph SW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, similar conditions persist with 4 ft @8s SE swell and fresh 27 mph ESE winds, keeping it messy. By the day after, the swell picks up to 9 ft @10s W, but with strong 33 mph SSW winds, it’ll be challenging. Best: today.
