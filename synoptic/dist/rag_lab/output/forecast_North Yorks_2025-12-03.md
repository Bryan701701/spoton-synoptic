Today in North Yorks, it's a fun 1 ft @ 8s NE with a fresh 15 mph SSW wind. Withernsea and Filey are your best bets, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow sees a drop to 2 ft @ 6s ESE with stronger 25 mph SSE winds, making it poor across the board. Day after brings back the 1 ft @ 8s ENE with light 7 mph SSW winds, making for clean conditions at Withernsea and Filey. Best: today.
