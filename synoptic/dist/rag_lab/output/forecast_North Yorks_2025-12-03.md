Today in North Yorks, surf is small but clean at 1 ft @ 8s NE with fresh 15 mph SSW winds. Withernsea, Filey, and Whitby Beach are all working well, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow sees a drop to 2 ft @ 6s ESE with fresh 25 mph SSE winds, making conditions poor across the region. Day after brings back the fun with 1 ft @ 8s ENE and light 7 mph SSW winds, perfect for a mellow session at Withernsea or Filey. Best: day after.
