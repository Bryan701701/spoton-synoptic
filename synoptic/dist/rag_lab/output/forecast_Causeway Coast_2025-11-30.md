Today, the Causeway Coast is lighting up with clean 3 ft @ 8s NW swell and a moderate 11 mph NW wind. Great spots like White Park Bay and Portballintrae are working well, especially during the tide windows from 09:27 to 17:01. Tomorrow, the surf drops to 1 ft @ 7s W, making it a quiet day with only Portballintrae showing any potential. By the day after, conditions worsen with 3 ft @ 12s WNW swell but fresh 20 mph S winds will make it blown out everywhere. Best: today.
