Today, the Causeway Coast is lighting up with clean 3 ft @ 8s NW swell and a moderate 11 mph NW wind. Best spots include White Park Bay and Portballintrae, both offering great conditions from 09:27 to 17:01. Tomorrow sees a drop to 1 ft @ 7s W with light 9 mph S winds, making it less exciting—only Portballintrae remains workable. Day after, conditions worsen with 3 ft @ 12s WNW swell but fresh 20 mph S winds will make it blown out across the coast. Best: today.
