North Devon is looking solid today with 5 ft @ 14s W swell and light 8 mph S winds. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are great picks, especially with Lynmouth's tide peaking from 08:15 to 16:08. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 7 ft @ 11s W swell and fresh 31 mph WSW winds, making it blown out and not workable. Day after, things ease to 4 ft @ 9s WSW with 17 mph SSE winds—better for a surf, especially at spots like Woolacombe and Croyde Beach. Best: today.
