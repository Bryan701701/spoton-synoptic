Today in Sutherland, it's a quiet one with no surf action—wrong swell angle and fresh ESE winds at 26 mph. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 1 ft @ 9s N swell and light SE winds, making Farr Bay and Sango Bay the best bets during the mid-tide push. Day after, expect similar 2 ft @ 5s SW swell but with fresh WSW winds, likely making it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
