Today in Sutherland, it’s a quiet day with no surf action—wrong swell angle and fresh ESE wind at 26 mph. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 1 ft @ 9s N swell and light SE winds, making Farr Bay and Sango Bay the best spots to check out. Day after, the swell picks up to 2 ft @ 5s SW but is blown out by fresh WSW winds at 24 mph. Best: tomorrow.
