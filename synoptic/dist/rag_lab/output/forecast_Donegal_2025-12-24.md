Today in Donegal, it's looking great with 5 ft @ 12s WNW swell and light E winds at 11 mph. Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are prime spots, especially from 08:58 to 16:06. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 11s WNW, but Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand will still have some fun waves with light ENE winds. Day after, expect 3 ft @ 11s W with NE winds, keeping spots like Magheroaty and Dooey Beach working well. Best: today.
