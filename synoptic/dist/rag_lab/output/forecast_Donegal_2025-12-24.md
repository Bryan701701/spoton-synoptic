Today in Donegal, it's looking great with 5 ft @12s WNW swell and light E winds at 11 mph. Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are prime spots, both offering clean conditions from 08:58 to 16:06. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2–3 ft @11s, still workable at Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand, but expect some onshore chop with winds at 13 mph. By the day after, conditions improve slightly with 3 ft @11s swell and lighter NE winds, making Magheroaty Beach and Dooey Beach solid picks again. Best: today.
