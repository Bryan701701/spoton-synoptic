Today, the South is looking fun with clean 2 ft @8s SSW swell and light 8 mph NW winds. Derrynane and Barley Cove are prime spots, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 6 ft @7s SSW with fresh 35 mph SSW winds, making it blown out and poor across the board. On the day after, we see a slight improvement with 4 ft @7s SSW swell and lighter 15 mph S winds, offering workable waves at several spots. Best: today.
