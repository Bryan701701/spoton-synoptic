Today, the South is looking fun with 2 ft @8s SSW swell and light 8 mph NW winds. Derrynane and Barley Cove are both clean and working well, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 6 ft @7s SSW with fresh 35 mph SSW winds, making it blown out and poor across the board. On the day after, things improve slightly to 4 ft @7s SSW with lighter 15 mph S winds, offering some workable options. Best: today.
