Today in Moray, it's a clean start with 1 ft @ 7s E at both Spey Bay and Lossiemouth, thanks to light E winds. Perfect for a relaxed session! Tomorrow sees a nice bump to 3 ft @ 8s E, but watch out for fresh SSE winds at 17 mph—sheltered spots like Lossiemouth should still be fun. Day after, conditions drop to 2 ft @ 5s E with strong SSE winds making it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
