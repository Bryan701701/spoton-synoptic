Today in Moray, you’ll find clean 1ft @7s E lines at Spey Bay and Lossiemouth, with light E winds keeping it nice. Tomorrow, conditions improve to 3ft @8s E with moderate 17 mph SSE winds; it’ll be a bit choppy but still fun at spots like Lossiemouth. Day after, the swell drops slightly to 2ft @5s E, but fresh 29 mph SSE winds will make it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
