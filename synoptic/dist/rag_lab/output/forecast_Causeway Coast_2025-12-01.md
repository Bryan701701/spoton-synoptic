Today on the Causeway Coast, Portballintrae is your go-to spot with clean 1ft @8s WNW swell and light 9 mph SW winds. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 3ft @12s WNW swell, though the wind picks up to 15 mph from the S, making it a bit choppy. The day after, expect 4ft @12s WNW swell but with fresh 20 mph S winds, leading to blown-out conditions. Best: tomorrow.
