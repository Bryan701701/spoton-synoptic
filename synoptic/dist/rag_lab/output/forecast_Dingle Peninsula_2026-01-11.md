Today on the Dingle Peninsula, conditions are poor with a hefty 7 ft @8s SW swell, but fresh 26 mph SSW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, expect a similar scenario with a stronger 10 ft @10s SW swell and winds picking up to 27 mph SW, keeping it messy. The day after, conditions improve with 8 ft @11s WNW swell and lighter 10 mph NNW winds, making for a much cleaner surf day at spots like Ballybunion Left and Garywilliam Point. Best: day after.
