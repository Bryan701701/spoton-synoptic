Today in Caithness, it's a quiet one with no surf action—flat conditions and no swell hitting the coast. Tomorrow sees a nice uptick with 5 ft @13s NW swell and moderate WSW winds, making spots like Point of Ness and Murkle Point workable. The day after looks even better with 4 ft @12s WNW swell and light S winds, perfect for catching some clean waves at the sheltered corners. Best: day after.
