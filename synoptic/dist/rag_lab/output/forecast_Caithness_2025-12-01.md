Today in Caithness, Sandside Bay is showing some fun with 3ft @9s N and a light 14 mph S wind, making it a clean option. Tomorrow, expect a solid bump to 5ft @13s NW with similar wind, keeping it workable at spots like Point of Ness and Murkle Point. The day after, conditions improve further with 4ft @12s W, light SSE winds, and plenty of good options at various spots. Best: tomorrow.
