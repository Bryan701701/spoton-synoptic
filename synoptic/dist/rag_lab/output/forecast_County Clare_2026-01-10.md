Today in County Clare, it's a bit of a struggle with 7 ft @11s WNW swell and fresh 19 mph WNW winds creating blown-out conditions. Tomorrow sees a drop to 4 ft @8s WSW with moderate 16 mph S winds, making for some workable surf at spots like Lahinch Beach and Cornish Left. The day after, conditions worsen with 4 ft @8s WSW and fresh 29 mph SSW winds, leading to poor surf quality across the board. Best: tomorrow.
