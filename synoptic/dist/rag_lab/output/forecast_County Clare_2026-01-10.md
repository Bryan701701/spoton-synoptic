Today in County Clare, surf is poor with 7 ft @11s WNW swell, but fresh 19 mph WNW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a drop to 4 ft @8s WSW, with winds easing to 16 mph S, providing some workable conditions at spots like Lahinch Beach and Cornish Left. The day after, conditions remain similar with 4 ft @8s WSW swell, but fresh 29 mph SSW winds will likely keep it messy. Best: tomorrow.
