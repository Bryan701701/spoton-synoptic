Today in the Hebrides, it's looking great with 5 ft @ 12s W swell and light 5 mph SSE winds. Good spots like Europie and Barvas will be fun, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 5 ft @ 11s W but winds pick up to 12 mph S, still offering workable conditions at the same spots. Day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 11s W with 8 mph SW winds, making for a quieter day. Best: today.
