Today on the East Coast, conditions are poor with 3 ft @8s NNE swell and fresh 22 mph WNW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 2 ft @5s N with moderate 12 mph WNW winds, still not producing much. Day after looks better with 2 ft @7s ENE swell and light 5 mph W winds, offering some clean options at spots like Dunbar and St Andrews West. Best: day after.
