Today on the East Coast, it's a bit of a struggle with 3 ft @8s NNE swell, but fresh 22 mph WNW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2 ft @5s N with lighter 12 mph WNW winds, still not producing much. The day after brings a slight improvement with 2 ft @7s ENE swell and light 5 mph W winds, offering some workable options at spots like Dunbar and St Andrews West. Best: day after.
