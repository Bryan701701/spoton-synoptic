Today, the North East is lighting up with 4 ft @ 8s NE swell and a fresh 14 mph W wind. Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach are prime spots, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 6s ENE, but conditions remain good with a light 11 mph NE wind, making it fun for all levels. On the day after, expect 4 ft @ 8s ENE with a gentle 3 mph SW breeze, perfect for a solid surf day. Best: day after.
