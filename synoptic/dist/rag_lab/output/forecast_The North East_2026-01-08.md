The North East is looking solid! Today, we've got 4 ft @ 8s NE swell with a fresh 14 mph W wind. Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach are your best bets, especially around their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 6s ENE with a lighter 11 mph NE wind, still offering fun waves at spots like Saltburn and Redcar. Day after, we see a return to 4 ft @ 8s ENE with light 3 mph SW winds, making for clean conditions at Saltburn Point and Saltburn Beach. Best: day after.
