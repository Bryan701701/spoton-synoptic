Today in South Devon, it’s a bit rough with 6 ft @9s SW swell and fresh 26 mph SW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 11 ft @9s SSW, but the 36 mph winds will keep things messy. Day after, conditions improve slightly with 6 ft @10s SW swell and lighter 17 mph winds, making it more workable at spots like Bovisand Reef and Challborough. Best: day after.
