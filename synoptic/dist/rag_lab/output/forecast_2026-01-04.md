The West Coast is looking solid today with 4 ft @ 6s NW swell and fresh 18 mph NNW winds. Balephetrish and Balevullin Bay are great picks, especially from 09:01 to 16:04. Tomorrow, conditions drop with fresh N winds at 26 mph, making it blown out across the board. On the day after, expect 4 ft @ 6s WNW swell with lighter 14 mph W winds, offering some workable options at spots like Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay. Best: today.
