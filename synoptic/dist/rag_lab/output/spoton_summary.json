  "text": "Today on the West Coast, conditions are poor with 5 ft @6s NNW swell and fresh 23 mph N winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 4 ft @6s WNW swell and 14 mph W winds, offering some workable corners like Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay. The day after, the swell remains at 4 ft @7s NW but freshens to 25 mph NNW winds, keeping it messy across the board. Best: tomorrow."
