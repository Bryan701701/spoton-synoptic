  "text": "Today on the West Coast, it's a bit rough with 5 ft @6s NNW swell and fresh 23 mph N wind, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 4 ft @6s WNW swell and lighter 14 mph W wind, providing some workable conditions at spots like Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay. The day after, conditions drop again with 4 ft @7s NW swell and fresh 25 mph NNW wind, leading to poor quality surf. Best: tomorrow."
