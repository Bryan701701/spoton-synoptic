  "text": "Today, the West Coast is flat with no surf energy, as the swell isn’t hitting this coast. Tomorrow, conditions remain poor with 6 ft @9s W but fresh 24 mph SSW winds will keep it blown out. The day after brings a solid 7 ft @10s WNW swell with light 8 mph SW winds, making it the best day for surf at spots like Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay. Best: day after."
