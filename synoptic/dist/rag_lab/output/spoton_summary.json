  "text": "Today, the West Coast is facing a fresh N wind at 28 mph, with a 6 ft @ 7s NNW swell, making conditions blown out and messy. Tomorrow, similar conditions persist with the same swell and wind, keeping it poor across the board. On the day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 6s NW, but the fresh NNW wind continues to create choppy surf. Best: none."
