  "text": "Today on the West Coast, it's a solid 3 ft @ 11s WNW with light E winds at 11 mph, making for clean conditions at spots like Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 9s, still workable but with fresh E winds at 17 mph, so look for sheltered corners. By the day after, the swell remains around 2 ft @ 7s, with Dunaverty offering the best chance for fun waves. Best: today."
