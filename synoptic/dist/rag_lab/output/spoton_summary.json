Tomorrow improves significantly with a clean 5 ft @10s NW swell and light 2 mph N winds, making for a great day at spots like Balephetrish and Balevullin Bay. The day after, conditions drop slightly to 5 ft @8s WNW with moderate 13 mph WSW winds, still offering some workable waves at a few corners. Best: tomorrow."
