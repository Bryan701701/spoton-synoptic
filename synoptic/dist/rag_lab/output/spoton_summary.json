  "text": "The West Coast is lighting up today with clean 3 ft @ 9s WNW swell and light 10 mph SSW winds. Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay are prime spots, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 4 ft @ 10s with light 3 mph NNE winds, keeping conditions fun and clean. Day after, expect 5 ft @ 12s with moderate 14 mph ESE winds, making for a bit of chop but still surfable. Best: tomorrow."
