  "text": "Today on the West Coast, it's a solid 6 ft @10s W with a light 12 mph SSW wind, making for clean conditions at spots like Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 5 ft @11s WNW with a fresh 17 mph SW wind, so expect some chop but still fun waves at sheltered corners. The day after brings a bit more energy with 7 ft @13s WNW, though the wind stays fresh at 13 mph SW. Best: today."
