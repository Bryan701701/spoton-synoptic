  "text": "Today on the West Coast, it's looking poor with 6 ft @7s NW swell and fresh 25 mph NNW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with the same swell size and a slight drop in wind to 21 mph N, still not producing. Day after, the wind eases to 15 mph N, offering a better chance for some fun at spots like Balephetrish and Balevullin Bay during the tide windows. Best: day after."
