  "text": "Today on the West Coast, conditions are poor with 4 ft @ 11s WNW swell, but fresh 21 mph SSE winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 7 ft @ 12s WSW, but strong 30 mph ESE winds will keep it messy. By the day after, conditions improve slightly with 5 ft @ 12s W swell and lighter 15 mph ENE winds, offering some workable options at spots like Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay. Best: day after."
