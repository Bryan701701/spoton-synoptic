Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay are your top picks, both offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 9s with fresh E winds at 17 mph, making it a bit choppy but still workable at sheltered spots. The day after, similar conditions persist with 2 ft @ 7s NNW swell and moderate E winds. Best: today."
