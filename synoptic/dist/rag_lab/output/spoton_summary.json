Perfect conditions for a fun session, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 7 ft @14s WNW with fresh 19 mph SSW winds, making it a blown-out day across the board. Day after, we see a return to 3 ft @11s W swell with 13 mph SE winds, offering some workable options at spots like Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay. Best: today."
