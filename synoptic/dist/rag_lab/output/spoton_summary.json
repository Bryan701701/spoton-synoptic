Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay are both clean and fun, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 5 ft @11s WNW with fresh SW winds at 17 mph, making it a bit choppy but still workable at sheltered spots. Day after, we see a nice bump to 7 ft @13s WNW, with similar winds, so expect some good action at the right corners. Best: today."
