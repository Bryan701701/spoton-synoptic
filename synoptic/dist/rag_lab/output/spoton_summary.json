Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay are your best bets, both offering clean conditions during their tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @ 9s, but remains fun with lighter winds at 11 mph W. By the day after, conditions worsen with 7 ft @ 13s W swell and fresh onshore winds, making it less appealing. Best: tomorrow."
