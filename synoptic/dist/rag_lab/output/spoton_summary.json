  "text": "Today on the West Coast, conditions are poor with a consistent 6 ft @ 7s NW swell but fresh 25 mph NNW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow remains similar with the same swell size and direction, but winds ease slightly to 21 mph N, still not producing anything worthwhile. On the day after, the swell holds at 6 ft @ 7s NW with winds dropping to 15 mph N, offering a better chance for some workable waves, especially during the tide windows. Best: day after."
