Today in Donegal, it’s looking fun with 3 ft @12s WNW swell and light 4 mph ENE winds. Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are your best bets, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @11s with moderate 11 mph ESE winds, still workable at the same spots. By the day after, expect similar conditions with 2 ft @11s NW swell and 10 mph SSW winds. Best: today.
