County Clare is lighting up today with clean 4 ft @12s WNW swell and light 8 mph ENE winds. Doolin Point and Lahinch Beach are prime spots, offering great conditions from morning till late afternoon. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 1 ft @10s, making it a flat day with no real surf action. The day after sees a slight bump to 2 ft @9s, but still not much to ride. Best: today.
