Today in County Clare, it's a bit rough with 7 ft @ 13s WSW swell and fresh 20 mph S winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with the same swell height but a shorter period of 9s and stronger 27 mph WSW winds, keeping it messy. Day after brings 5 ft @ 10s WSW swell, but with 37 mph S winds, it will still be challenging. Best: today.
