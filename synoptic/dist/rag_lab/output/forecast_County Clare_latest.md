Today in County Clare, it's a quiet day with 2 ft @5s W swell and fresh 12 mph SSW wind. Tomorrow brings a nice boost with 4 ft @8s WNW swell, making for workable conditions at spots like Doolin Point and Lahinch Beach. The day after, conditions improve further with 4 ft @9s WNW and light 4 mph SE winds, creating clean surf at Lahinch and Cornish Left. Best: day after.
