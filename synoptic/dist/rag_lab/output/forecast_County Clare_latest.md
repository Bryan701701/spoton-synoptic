Today in County Clare, it's a bit of a struggle with 4 ft @8s WSW swell but fresh 22 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 3 ft @8s with 21 mph SSW winds, still not producing much. On the day after, conditions improve with 3 ft @10s WNW swell and light 3 mph SSE winds, offering some fun options at spots like Lahinch Beach and Cregg Beach. Best: day after.
