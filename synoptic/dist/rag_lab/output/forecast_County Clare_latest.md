County Clare is lighting up today with 8 ft @ 13s W swell and fresh 15 mph W winds. Crab Island and Doolin Point are your best bets, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 9 ft @ 11s W swell and light 6 mph WNW winds, making for a fun day at spots like Lahinch Beach and Cornish Left. By the day after, the swell drops to 6 ft but winds pick up to 22 mph SE, resulting in blown-out conditions. Best: tomorrow.
