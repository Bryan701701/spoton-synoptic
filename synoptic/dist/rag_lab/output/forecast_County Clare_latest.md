Today in County Clare, it's a quiet start with 1 ft @11s W and light ESE winds; not producing much. Tomorrow sees a slight bump to 2 ft @8s WNW, but fresh 18 mph WNW winds will keep it messy. The day after, similar 2 ft @6s NW conditions with stronger 22 mph N winds will make it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
