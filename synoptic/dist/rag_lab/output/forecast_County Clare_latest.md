Today in County Clare, expect 3 ft @9s W with fresh 17 mph SSE winds. It's a bit choppy, but sheltered corners like Lahinch Beach and Lahinch Left are working well. Tomorrow, conditions improve with a solid 5 ft @15s WNW and light 7 mph S winds, making for great surf all day. The day after, it drops back to 3 ft @12s WNW with light 4 mph SSW winds, still offering fun waves at spots like Lahinch and Cornish Left. Best: tomorrow.
