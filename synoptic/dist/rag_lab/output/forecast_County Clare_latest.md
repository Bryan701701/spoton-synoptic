County Clare is lighting up today with 9 ft @10s WSW swell and fresh 17 mph SSW winds. Crab Island and Doolin Point are your best bets, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 5 ft @17s with moderate 14 mph SSE winds, still offering some fun at spots like Lahinch Beach and Doolin Point. By the day after, conditions turn poor with 7 ft @14s W but fresh 24 mph W winds, making it blown out across the board. Best: today.
