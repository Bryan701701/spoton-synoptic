County Clare is looking solid today with 6 ft @10s WSW swell and fresh 16 mph SSW winds. Doolin Point and Lahinch Beach are your best bets, especially on the mid-morning push. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 6 ft @12s W swell and light 5 mph SSE winds, making it a great day for all spots. Day after, expect 9 ft @13s W swell with fresh 17 mph WSW winds; it’ll be a bit choppy but still fun at sheltered locations. Best: tomorrow.
