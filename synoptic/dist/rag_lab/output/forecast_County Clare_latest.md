Today in County Clare, it's a no-go with fresh 30 mph WSW winds creating a blown-out scene, and the swell is a hefty 11 ft @ 13s W. Tomorrow, conditions remain poor with 4 ft @ 9s W and 21 mph SSE winds, still not producing anything fun. By the day after, we see a significant improvement with 11 ft @ 15s W and light 3 mph SSE winds, making it a great day to hit the surf at spots like Crab Island and Doolin Point. Best: day after.
