Today in County Clare, we're looking at a solid 7 ft @10s W swell with fresh 14 mph W winds. Crab Island and Doolin Point are your best bets, offering clean conditions during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 10 ft @14s WNW but with fresh 22 mph SSE winds, making it blown out and poor across the board. Day after, the swell eases to 8 ft @12s WSW, but winds remain fresh at 18 mph, keeping conditions challenging. Best: today.
