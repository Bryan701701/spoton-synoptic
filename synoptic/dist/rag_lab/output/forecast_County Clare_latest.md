Today in County Clare, it's a no-go with fresh 34 mph W winds and a hefty 9 ft @ 12s W swell creating a blown-out scene. Tomorrow brings a nice change with 4 ft @ 11s W swell and light 8 mph SE winds, making for clean conditions at spots like Doolin Point and Lahinch Beach. Day after, the swell bumps up to 7 ft @ 11s WSW, but with fresh 24 mph SSW winds, it’ll be messy again. Best: tomorrow.
