Today in County Clare, it's looking solid with 10 ft @ 13s W swell and a fresh 16 mph SSW wind. Best spots include Crab Island and Doolin Point, both offering good windows throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 12 ft @ 13s W swell but fresh 19 mph W winds make it poor across the board. The day after, we're down to 6 ft @ 10s W with 22 mph WNW winds, still not ideal. Best: today.
