Today in County Clare, surf is looking good with 3 ft @ 8s WNW at spots like Lahinch Beach and Cregg Beach, both working well under light NNW winds at 7 mph. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @ 9s W but with fresh S winds at 20 mph, making it blown out and poor across the board. By the day after, we see a significant jump to 9 ft @ 13s W, but with 17 mph WSW winds, it remains a mixed bag—some spots like Lahinch Beach may still offer fun waves. Best: today.
