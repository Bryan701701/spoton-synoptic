County Clare is looking great today with 4 ft @ 11s W swell and a moderate 11 mph SW wind. Doolin Point and Lahinch Beach are prime spots, offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell ramps up to 9 ft @ 12s WSW, but fresh 23 mph SSW winds will make it blown out and poor. Day after, conditions remain challenging with 7 ft @ 12s WSW and 30 mph S winds. Best: today.
