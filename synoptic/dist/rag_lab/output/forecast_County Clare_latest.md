County Clare is lighting up today with clean 4 ft @12s WNW swell and light 4 mph S winds. Doolin Point and Lahinch Beach are prime spots, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 6 ft @10s WSW with fresh 18 mph SSW winds, making it poor across the board. The day after, expect even bigger 11 ft @17s W but with strong 21 mph SE winds, so it’s best to sit this one out. Best: today.
