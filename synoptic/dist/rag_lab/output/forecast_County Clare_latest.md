Today in County Clare, we’ve got some fun surf with 3 ft @ 8s WNW at spots like Lahinch Beach and Cregg Beach, both working nicely with light 4 mph NNW winds. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 5 ft @ 9s WNW, offering great conditions at multiple locations including Doughmore and Killard, with winds at 9 mph W. On the day after, conditions drop to 4 ft @ 10s WNW but fresh 23 mph W winds will make it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
