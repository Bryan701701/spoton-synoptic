Today in County Clare, we have solid surf with 9 ft @10s WSW and fresh 17 mph SSW winds. Best spots include Crab Island and Doolin Point, both offering fun waves throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 5 ft @17s W, but conditions remain workable with 14 mph SSE winds. The day after, expect 7 ft @14s W, but fresh 24 mph winds will likely make it blown out. Best: today.
