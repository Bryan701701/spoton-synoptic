Today in County Clare, it's looking solid with 6 ft @10s W swell and light 7 mph N winds. Doolin Point and Lahinch Beach are prime spots, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @9s WNW, but Lahinch Beach and Cregg Beach still have some fun waves rolling in. On the day after, expect 5 ft @9s W with light SSE winds, keeping spots like Doolin Point and Lahinch Beach working well. Best: today.
