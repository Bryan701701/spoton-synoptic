Today in County Clare, surf is small and not producing, with 2 ft @8s NW and light SSE winds. Tomorrow drops further to 1 ft @5s NW, still with NNE winds, making it a quiet day. By the day after, we see a slight increase to 3 ft @5s WNW, but fresh 26 mph WSW winds will make it blown out. Best: today.
