Today in County Clare, it's a bit of a struggle with fresh SSW winds at 21 mph and a hefty 7 ft @ 9s WSW swell, making it blown out across the board—best to give it a miss. Tomorrow sees a drop to 4 ft @ 9s W with lighter N winds at 17 mph, offering some workable conditions at spots like Doolin Point and Lahinch Beach during the tide windows. The day after, conditions remain similar with 5 ft @ 8s W swell but fresh S winds, keeping it messy again. Best: tomorrow.
