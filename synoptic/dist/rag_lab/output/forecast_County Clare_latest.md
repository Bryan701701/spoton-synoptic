County Clare is lighting up today with clean 4ft @11s W swell and a moderate 11 mph SW wind. Doolin Point and Lahinch Beach are prime spots, both working well throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop with a hefty 9ft @12s WSW swell and fresh 23 mph SSW winds, making it poor for surfing. Day after, similar conditions persist with 7ft @12s WSW and strong 30 mph S winds, keeping the surf challenging. Best: today.
