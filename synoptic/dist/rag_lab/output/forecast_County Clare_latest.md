Today in County Clare, it's a bit of a struggle with 6 ft @12s WSW swell and fresh 21 mph SSW winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 5 ft @13s WSW, but the 23 mph S winds will keep things messy. The day after, conditions worsen further with 7 ft @9s W swell and 24 mph WSW winds, making it challenging across the board. Best: today.
