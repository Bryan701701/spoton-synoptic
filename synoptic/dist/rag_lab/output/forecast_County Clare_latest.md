Today in County Clare, it’s a bit of a struggle with 5 ft @8s W swell and fresh 21 mph WSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 4 ft @9s WSW with 24 mph S winds, still not ideal. The day after brings a solid 9 ft @15s W swell, but winds remain fresh at 19 mph SSE, keeping it challenging. Best: day after.
