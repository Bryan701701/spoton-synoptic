Today in County Clare, it's looking great with a solid 7 ft @ 12s W swell and light 6 mph S winds. Spots like Crab Island and Doolin Point are firing, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow sees a drop to 4 ft @ 12s WNW with moderate 12 mph SSW winds, but still workable at places like Lahinch Beach. By the day after, the swell picks back up to 9 ft @ 10s WSW, though winds will be fresh at 18 mph SSW, making it a bit choppy. Best: today.
