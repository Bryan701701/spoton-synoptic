County Clare is lighting up today with solid surf: 14 ft @ 16s W and light 9 mph SSE winds. Best spots include Crab Island and Doolin Point, both offering great windows throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 8 ft @ 14s W with fresh 15 mph S winds, still workable at several spots like Lahinch and Green Point. By the day after, conditions decline further to 4 ft @ 9s WSW, with stronger winds making it less inviting. Best: today.
