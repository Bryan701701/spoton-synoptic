Today in County Clare, it's looking great with 4 ft @ 12s WNW swell and light 4 mph S winds. Doolin Point and Lahinch Beach are prime spots, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 6 ft @ 10s WSW with fresh 18 mph SSW winds, making it poor across the board. The day after, it ramps up to 11 ft @ 17s W but with strong 21 mph SE winds, so it’s not ideal either. Best: today.
