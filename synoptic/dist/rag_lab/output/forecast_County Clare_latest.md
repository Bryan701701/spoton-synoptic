Today in County Clare, it's a quiet scene with 3 ft @ 6s NW swell, but fresh 9 mph NNW winds are making it a bit messy. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 6s NW with 10 mph N winds, keeping things on the smaller side and still not producing much. By the day after, we're looking at 1 ft @ 7s NW with light 2 mph S winds, which means it’s flat and not really surfable. Best: today.
