Today in County Clare, it's a solid day with 10 ft @ 13s W swell and fresh 16 mph SSW winds. Crab Island and Doolin Point are your best bets, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 12 ft @ 13s W with fresh 19 mph W winds, making it a poor day for surf. The day after, expect 6 ft @ 10s W with strong 22 mph WNW winds, keeping it blown out. Best: today.
