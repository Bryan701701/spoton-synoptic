County Clare is looking good today with 3 ft @8s WNW swell and light 4 mph NNW winds. Lahinch Beach and Cregg Beach are both offering fun conditions, especially on the push from 08:48 to 16:40. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 5 ft @9s, with winds picking up to 9 mph W, making for a solid day at spots like Doolin Point and Doughmore. Day after, winds ramp up to 23 mph WNW, leading to blown-out conditions across the coast. Best: tomorrow.
