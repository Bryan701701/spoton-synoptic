Today in County Clare, it's a quiet day with 2 ft @9s WNW swell and fresh 11 mph NE winds creating some chop. Tomorrow remains similar with the same swell size and a lighter 5 mph NNE wind, but still not producing much. The day after offers a bit of improvement with 2 ft @10s WNW swell and light 8 mph E winds, yet conditions remain poor. Best: day after.
