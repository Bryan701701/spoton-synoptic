Today in County Clare, it's a bit of a bummer with 2 ft @6s NW swell and fresh 19 mph N wind making it blown out. Tomorrow drops to 1 ft @7s NW with light 3 mph ENE winds, so it's looking quiet. The day after sees a slight bump back to 2 ft @5s NW, but with 13 mph NNW winds, it’ll still be choppy. Best: day after.
