Today in County Clare, surf is looking fun with 3 ft @ 12s WNW at spots like Lahinch Beach and Lahinch Left, both holding shape under light NNE winds at 6 mph. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2 ft @ 10s WNW with very light SSW winds, making it a bit poor across the board. Day after, surf picks up to 4 ft @ 12s WNW, with NE winds at 11 mph, providing some solid options at places like Doolin Point and Lahinch. Best: today.
