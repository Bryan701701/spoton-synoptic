Today in County Clare, it’s a no-go with 6 ft @12s WSW swell and fresh 21 mph SSW winds making for a blown-out scene. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 5 ft @13s, but the fresh 23 mph S wind keeps it messy. Day after, the swell picks up to 7 ft @9s, yet the wind ramps up to 24 mph WSW, making it tough. Best: none.
