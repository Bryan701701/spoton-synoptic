Today in County Clare, it's a quiet day with 2 ft @6s NW swell and light NNE winds. The surf isn't producing much, so it might be best to give it a miss. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 3 ft @5s WNW swell and moderate WSW winds, making for some fun waves at spots like Lahinch Beach and Cregg Beach. The day after, expect similar 3 ft @7s NW swell, but with fresh NW winds, so look for sheltered corners. Best: tomorrow.
