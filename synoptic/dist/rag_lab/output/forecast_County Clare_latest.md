Today in County Clare, it's a no-go with fresh W winds at 34 mph, creating a blown-out scene with 9 ft @12s W swell. Tomorrow looks much better as conditions improve with 4 ft @11s W swell and light SE winds at 8 mph, making spots like Doolin Point and Lahinch Beach work well. The day after, swell picks up to 7 ft @11s WSW but with fresh SSW winds at 24 mph, likely making it messy again. Best: tomorrow.
