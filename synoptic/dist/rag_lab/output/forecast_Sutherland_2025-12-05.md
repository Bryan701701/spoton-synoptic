Today in Sutherland, it's looking solid with 3 ft @ 14s WNW swell and fresh 25 mph SE winds. Melvich and Strathy are great picks, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @ 7s E with strong 38 mph ESE winds, making it poor across the board. Day after brings back some fun with 3 ft @ 11s WNW and lighter 16 mph ESE winds; Balnakeil and Sandwood Bay should be the go-to spots. Best: today.
