Today in Sutherland, it's looking solid with 3 ft @14s WNW swell and fresh 25 mph SE winds. Melvich and Strathy are both working well, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @7s E with strong 38 mph ESE winds, making it poor across the board. On the day after, expect 3 ft @11s WNW with lighter 16 mph ESE winds, offering some good options at Balnakeil and Sandwood Bay. Best: today.
