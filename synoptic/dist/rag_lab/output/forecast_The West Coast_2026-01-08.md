Today on the West Coast, it's looking good with 3 ft @ 9s WNW swell and light 10 mph SSW winds. Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay are your best bets, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 4 ft @ 10s with light 3 mph NNE winds, keeping it clean and fun. Day after, expect 5 ft @ 12s with a moderate 14 mph ESE breeze, making it a bit choppy but still rideable at sheltered spots. Best: tomorrow.
