Today in County Clare, it's a quiet day with 3 ft @ 6s NW swell but fresh 9 mph NNW winds making it messy. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 6s NW with 10 mph N winds, still not producing much. The day after sees a further decline to 1 ft @ 7s NW with light 2 mph S winds, so not much happening. Best: today.
