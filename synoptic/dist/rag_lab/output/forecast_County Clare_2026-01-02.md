Today in County Clare, it's a quiet scene with 3 ft @ 6s NW swell but fresh 9 mph NNW wind making it a bit messy. Tomorrow sees a drop to 2 ft @ 6s NW with 10 mph N wind, still not producing much. Day after, the swell further declines to 1 ft @ 7s NW and light 2 mph S winds, leaving it flat and unworkable. Best: today.
