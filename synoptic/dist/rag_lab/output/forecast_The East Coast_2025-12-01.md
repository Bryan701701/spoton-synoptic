Today on the East Coast, it's a bit of a bummer with no surf action—5 ft @6s SSE but fresh 25 mph S winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow looks much better with 4 ft @7s SE and light 10 mph WSW winds at spots like Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay, so expect some clean conditions. The day after, conditions drop to 3 ft @5s SSE with moderate 15 mph S winds, still workable at the same spots. Best: tomorrow.
