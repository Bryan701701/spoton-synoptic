Today on the East Coast, it’s a quiet day with no surf action—wrong swell angle and fresh 22 mph SSW wind has it blown out. Tomorrow brings some improvement with 3 ft @7s SE swell and lighter 9 mph SW winds, making spots like Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay workable. The day after looks similar with 3 ft @6s SE and light 7 mph S winds, keeping those same spots in play. Best: tomorrow.
