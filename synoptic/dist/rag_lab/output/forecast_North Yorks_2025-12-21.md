North Yorks is looking fun today with 2 ft @5s ESE swell and light 10 mph ESE winds. Withernsea and Filey are both clean and ideal for a session, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 4 ft @6s, but winds freshen to 17 mph ESE, making it a bit choppy. The day after, conditions drop back to 2 ft @6s, still workable but less punchy. Best: today.
