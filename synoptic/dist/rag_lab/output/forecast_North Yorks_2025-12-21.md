Today in North Yorks, it's a fun 2 ft @5s ESE with light 10 mph ESE winds. Good spots like Withernsea and Filey are working well, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, we see a bump to 4 ft @6s with fresh 17 mph ESE winds, so expect some chop but still decent surf at places like Bunkers and Pumphouse. The day after, the swell drops back to 2 ft @6s, but conditions remain workable. Best: tomorrow.
