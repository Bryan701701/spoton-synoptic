Today on the West Coast, it’s looking solid with 4 ft @ 11s WNW swell and light 5 mph NNW winds. Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay are the top picks, both offering clean conditions throughout their tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 6 ft @ 12s WNW with moderate 13 mph S winds, making it a bit choppy but still fun at sheltered spots. Day after, expect poor conditions with 4 ft @ 6s SSW swell and strong 32 mph SSE winds, likely making it blown out. Best: today.
