Today, Gower is seeing small, weak surf at 2 ft @6s with fresh 8 mph NE winds. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with the same size but a short period of 5s and fresh 26 mph NE winds, making it blown out. The day after drops further to 1 ft @5s, still with light winds but not producing any surf. Best: today.
