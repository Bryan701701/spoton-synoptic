Today in Caithness, surf is looking fun with 4 ft @ 11s W at spots like Point of Ness and Murkle Point, with a light 12 mph S wind keeping it clean. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 5 ft @ 8s ESE and fresh 24 mph SSE winds making it blown out and poor. Day after, still poor with 3 ft @ 7s ESE and 29 mph S winds, not ideal for surfing. Best: today.
