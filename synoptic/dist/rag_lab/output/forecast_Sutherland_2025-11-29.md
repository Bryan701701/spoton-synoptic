Today at Sutherland, Sango Bay is lighting up with a solid 7 ft @10s NNW swell and fresh 19 mph NNW winds. It's best on the mid-tide push from 09:39 to 16:34. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 6 ft @10s N swell and lighter 8 mph NNE winds, making it a great day for a session at spots like Melvich and Strathy. The day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @7s W, but with manageable winds at 14 mph SSE, it's still workable at Sango Bay and nearby spots. Best: today.
