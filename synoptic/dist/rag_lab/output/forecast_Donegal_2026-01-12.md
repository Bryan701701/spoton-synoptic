Today in Donegal, it's a bit of a bummer with poor conditions across the board—7 ft @8s W swell but fresh 21 mph SW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow looks promising, with a solid 7 ft @10s NW swell and light 10 mph NW winds, creating clean conditions at spots like Pollan Bay and Ballyheiran Bay. Day after, the swell drops slightly to 6 ft @9s NW with fresh 16 mph SSW winds, but still some workable waves at Magheroaty Beach and Bloody Foreland. Best: tomorrow.
