Today in North Yorks, it's looking fun with 2 ft @7s ENE swell and fresh 16 mph SW winds. Withernsea and Filey are your best bets, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, expect similar conditions with 2 ft @6s SE swell and moderate 14 mph S winds; still workable at the same spots. Day after, the swell drops to 1 ft @4s SSE, leaving it pretty flat across the region. Best: today.
