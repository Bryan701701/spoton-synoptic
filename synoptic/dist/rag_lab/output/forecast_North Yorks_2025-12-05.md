Today in North Yorks, it’s looking fun with 2 ft @7s ENE swell and fresh 16 mph SW winds. Withernsea and Filey are your best bets, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 2 ft @6s SE, but still offers workable conditions at spots like Whitby Beach and South Bay. By the day after, conditions fade to 1 ft @4s SSE, making it a quiet day across the coast. Best: today.
