Today in North Yorks, surf is on at 2 ft @ 7s ENE with fresh 16 mph SW winds. Withernsea and Filey are your best bets, especially early and mid-day. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 2 ft @ 6s SE; still workable at Withernsea and Filey. Day after drops to 1 ft @ 4s SSE and looks pretty flat across the board. Best: today.
