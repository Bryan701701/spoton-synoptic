Today in North Yorks, we’ve got some fun options with 2 ft @7s ENE swell and fresh 16 mph SW winds. Withernsea and Filey are looking particularly good, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 2 ft @6s SE swell, but winds ease a bit to 14 mph S, keeping it workable. By the day after, the swell drops to 1 ft @4s SSE, so it’s best to hit the water today or tomorrow. Best: today.
