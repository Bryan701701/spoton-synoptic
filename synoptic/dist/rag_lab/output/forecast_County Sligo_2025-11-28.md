Today in County Sligo, conditions are poor with a hefty 9 ft @ 13s WNW swell, but fresh 21 mph WSW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 7 ft @ 11s NNW swell and moderate 16 mph NE winds, but still not ideal—Strandhill remains poor. By the day after, the swell drops to a more manageable 4 ft @ 9s NNW with light 8 mph SW winds, offering a better chance for fun waves at spots like Dunmoran Strand. Best: day after.
