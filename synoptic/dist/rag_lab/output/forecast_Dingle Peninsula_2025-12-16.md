Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it's looking solid with 8 ft @12s W swell and a moderate 14 mph W wind. Best spots include Ballybunion Left and Garywilliam Point, both peaking early from 08:44 to 09:08. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 10 ft @10s WSW swell but fresh 30 mph SW winds will make it blown out. The day after, expect even bigger 16 ft @15s W swell, but again, strong 33 mph S winds will keep it messy. Best: today.
