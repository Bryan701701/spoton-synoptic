Today on the Dingle Peninsula, surf is looking solid at 8 ft @ 12s W with a moderate 14 mph W wind. Best spots include Ballybunion Left and Garywilliam Point, both peaking early from 08:44 to 09:08. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 10 ft @ 10s WSW with fresh 30 mph SW winds, making it blown out and poor across the board. The day after, expect even bigger 16 ft @ 15s W swell but with strong 33 mph S winds, keeping it messy. Best: today.
