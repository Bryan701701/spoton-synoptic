Today in North Yorks, it's looking good with 4 ft @ 8s NNE swell and a fresh 12 mph NE wind. Withernsea and Filey are prime spots, especially during the morning and afternoon tides. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 3 ft @ 8s, but conditions remain clean with 10 mph NNE winds, making it still fun at spots like Bunkers and North Bay. By the day after, expect a bump back up to 5 ft @ 8s, with similar wind, offering solid options at all the usual breaks. Best: today.
