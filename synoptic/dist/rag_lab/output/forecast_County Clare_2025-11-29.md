Today in County Clare, it’s looking solid with 6 ft @10s W swell and light N winds. Doolin Point and Lahinch Beach are great picks, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @9s WNW with a moderate WNW wind, making it a bit less exciting but still fun at spots like Lahinch Beach. The day after, conditions improve again with 5 ft @9s W swell and light SSE winds, perfect for a surf session at Doolin Point or Lahinch. Best: today.
