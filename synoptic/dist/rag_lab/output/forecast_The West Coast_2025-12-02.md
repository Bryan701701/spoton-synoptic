Today on the West Coast, it’s a bit rough with 7 ft @12s W swell and fresh 24 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with similar swell but increasing winds at 29 mph, keeping it messy. By the day after, the swell drops to 4 ft @9s WSW, but the 32 mph ESE winds will still make it challenging. Best: today.
