Today on the West Coast, it’s a bit rough with 7 ft @12s W swell and fresh 24 mph SSW winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees similar conditions, with the swell holding but winds picking up to 29 mph, keeping it messy. By the day after, the swell drops to 4 ft @9s WSW, but with strong 32 mph ESE winds, it remains poor. Best: today.
