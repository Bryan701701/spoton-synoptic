Today, the Causeway Coast is facing poor conditions with a solid 6 ft @10s W swell, but fresh 19 mph SSW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 4 ft @10s W, with stronger 23 mph S winds continuing to chop things up. By the day after, conditions improve with a 5 ft @14s WNW swell and lighter 12 mph SSE winds, making it a much better day for surfing at spots like White Park Bay and Portballintrae. Best: day after.
