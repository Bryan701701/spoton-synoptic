Today on the Causeway Coast, it’s a bit rough with 6 ft @10s W swell and fresh 19 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 4 ft @10s W with 23 mph S winds, still not producing much. Day after brings cleaner conditions with 5 ft @14s WNW swell and lighter 12 mph SSE winds, especially good at White Park Bay and Portballintrae. Best: day after.
