Today in the Hebrides, it's a no-go with 15 ft @11s WSW swell and fresh 47 mph SW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions remain poor with 10 ft @10s SW swell and 40 mph S winds—still not producing. On the day after, the swell eases slightly to 11 ft @13s WSW, but the 33 mph SSW winds keep it messy. Best: none.
