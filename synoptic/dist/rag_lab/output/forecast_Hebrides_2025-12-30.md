Today in the Hebrides, it's looking great with 4 ft @ 12s N swell and light SE winds at 6 mph. Tolsta and Port of Ness are both firing, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 5 ft @ 9s NNW swell and fresh W winds at 23 mph, making it blown out across the board. The day after, it ramps up to 12 ft @ 10s NNW but with strong NNW winds at 32 mph, keeping it poor everywhere. Best: today.
