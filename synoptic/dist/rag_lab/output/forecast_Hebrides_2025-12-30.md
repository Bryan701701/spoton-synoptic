Today in the Hebrides, it’s looking great with 4 ft @ 12s N swell and light 6 mph SE winds. Tolsta and Port of Ness are prime spots, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 5 ft @ 9s NNW with fresh 23 mph W winds, making it blown out and poor across the board. The day after brings a hefty 12 ft @ 10s NNW swell with strong 32 mph NNW winds, keeping it challenging and messy. Best: today.
