North Yorks is lighting up today with 4 ft @ 7s E swell and fresh 16 mph E winds. Withernsea and Filey are your best bets, both offering fun conditions from mid-morning to afternoon. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @ 5s E with fresh 22 mph ENE winds, making it a poor day for surf. Day after sees a slight improvement with 3 ft @ 5s E and lighter 13 mph ENE winds, still not ideal but workable at sheltered spots. Best: today.
