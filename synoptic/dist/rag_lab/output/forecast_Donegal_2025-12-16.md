Today in Donegal, it's looking solid with 6 ft @12s W swell and 11 mph SW winds. Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand are clean and fun, especially on the push. Tomorrow, expect a drop to 5 ft @9s W with fresh 30 mph onshore winds, making it blown out and poor. By the day after, swell picks back up to 10 ft @16s W, but with stronger winds, so it might be a bit messy. Best: today.
