Today in Donegal, it's looking great with 6 ft @12s W swell and 11 mph SW winds. Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand are prime spots, offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 5 ft @10s W with fresh 30 mph S winds, making it blown out and poor across the coast. By the day after, the swell picks up to 10 ft @16s W, but the wind remains strong at 12 mph S, so look for sheltered corners. Best: today.
