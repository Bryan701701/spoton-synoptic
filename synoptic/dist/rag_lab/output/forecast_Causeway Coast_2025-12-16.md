Today on the Causeway Coast, White Park Bay and Portballintrae are working well with 5 ft @12s WNW swell and a moderate 16 mph SSW wind. Expect clean conditions early, especially between 08:47 and 15:55. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 4 ft @8s WSW swell and a fresh 39 mph S wind, making it blown out and poor. Day after, the swell picks up to 7 ft @15s WNW, but with similar wind conditions, it remains challenging. Best: today.
