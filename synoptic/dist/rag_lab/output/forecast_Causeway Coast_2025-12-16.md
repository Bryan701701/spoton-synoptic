Today on the Causeway Coast, we're looking at a fun 5 ft @ 12s WNW swell with 16 mph SSW winds. White Park Bay and Portballintrae are your best bets, especially between 08:47 and 15:55. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @ 8s WSW with fresh 39 mph S winds, making it blown out and not producing. Day after, the swell picks up to 7 ft @ 15s WNW, but winds remain fresh at 17 mph SSE, still challenging. Best: today.
