Today in Cornwall, the North coast is firing with solid 7 ft @ 13s W swell and light 12 mph SW winds. Crantock and Fistral are prime spots, especially during the early tides. The South coast is also looking good, with Porthcurno and Praa Sands offering 7 ft @ 12s W swell, light 4 mph SSE winds, and great conditions throughout the day. Over on the West, Sennen Cove and Gwenvor are holding 8 ft @ 13s W, with moderate winds, making for fun surf. 

Tomorrow, expect a drop in quality across all coasts as strong NW winds kick in, leading to blown-out conditions. The North and South will struggle with 8 ft @ 10s W swell, while the West will see similar conditions. 

On the day after, the North coast rebounds with 7 ft @ 12s W swell and light SSE winds, making it the best choice for surf. 

Best: today.
