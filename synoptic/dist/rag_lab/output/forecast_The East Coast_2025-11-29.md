Today on the East Coast, it's looking pretty flat with 1 ft @6s SSE and fresh 17 mph NNW winds. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 3 ft @6s NNE, but still not producing much—Aberdeen Harbour might offer a bit of action. By the day after, the swell holds at 3 ft @6s SSE with lighter winds, making for a better surf day at spots like Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay. Best: day after.
