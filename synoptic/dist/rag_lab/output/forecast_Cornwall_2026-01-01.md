Today in Cornwall, surf is small and a bit blown out with 1ft @8s SW at Penhale, but it’s still workable during the mid-afternoon tide window. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with 3ft @5s NW across the coast, fresh winds making it choppy. The day after sees a similar pattern with 4ft @6s NNW, still messy due to strong winds. Best: today.
