Today, Cornwall is seeing some small surf with Penhale offering 1ft @8s SW and a light 13 mph WNW wind; it’s a workable spot during the mid-afternoon tide. Tomorrow, conditions drop a bit with 3ft @5s NW across the North, but fresh 24 mph NW winds will make it challenging. The day after, expect 4ft @6s NNW, but again, strong winds at 26 mph will keep it blown out. Best: today.
