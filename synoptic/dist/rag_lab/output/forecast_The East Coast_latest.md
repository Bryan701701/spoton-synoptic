Today on the East Coast, it's looking great with 4 ft @ 7s SE swell and a moderate 11 mph WSW wind. Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay are the top picks, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @ 6s SSE with fresh 25 mph S winds, making it a poor day for surf. The day after, we see 3 ft @ 5s SSE with 15 mph S winds, which is workable at sheltered spots like Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay. Best: today.
