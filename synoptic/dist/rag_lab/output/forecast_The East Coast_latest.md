Today on the East Coast, conditions are poor with 3 ft @5s S swell and fresh 20 mph S winds. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 3 ft @6s SSE swell and 16 mph SSW winds, making spots like Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay workable during the mid-tide windows. The day after, the swell increases to 4 ft @7s SSE, but fresh 23 mph SSW winds will likely keep it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
