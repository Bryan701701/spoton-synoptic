The East Coast has some fun options today with 1 ft @ 6s ESE swell and a moderate 12 mph NW wind. St Andrews West and Arbroath are both working well, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 2 ft @ 7s NE swell and light 7 mph WNW winds, making for a great day at multiple spots. The day after, however, looks poor with 1 ft @ 7s NNE swell and winds picking up to 9 mph, so it’s best to hit the water tomorrow. Best: tomorrow.
