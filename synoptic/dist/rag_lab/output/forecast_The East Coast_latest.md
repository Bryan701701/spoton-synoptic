The East Coast is lighting up today with 4 ft @ 7s SE swell and a moderate 11 mph WSW wind. Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay are the top picks, offering clean conditions during the tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @ 6s SSE with fresh 25 mph S winds, making it poor across the board. Day after, still 3 ft @ 5s SSE with 15 mph S winds, but a bit more workable at Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay. Best: today.
