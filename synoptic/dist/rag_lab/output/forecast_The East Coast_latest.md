Today on the East Coast, it's looking good with 4 ft @ 6s SSE at Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay, both holding shape under a fresh 15 mph SSW wind. Sandford Bay is also in the mix, offering similar conditions. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 5s, with fresh 20 mph SSW winds making it less inviting. Day after, we see a slight improvement with 3 ft @ 5s, but still on the lower end. Best: today.
