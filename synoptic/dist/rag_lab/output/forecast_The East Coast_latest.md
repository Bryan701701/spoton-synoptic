Today on the East Coast, conditions are poor with 3 ft @5s S swell and fresh 20 mph S winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 3 ft @6s SSE swell and moderate 16 mph SSW winds, offering some workable options at Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay during the mid-tide windows. The day after, swell increases to 4 ft @7s SSE, but fresh 23 mph SSW winds will likely keep it messy. Best: tomorrow.
