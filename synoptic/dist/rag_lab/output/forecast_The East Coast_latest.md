The East Coast is looking solid today with Aberdeen Harbour showing 3 ft @9s NE and light 8 mph NW winds. It's a great time to hit the water, especially between 08:48 and 15:33. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2 ft @10s NNE with fresh 17 mph WNW winds, making it a bit choppy but still surfable at sheltered spots. Day after, expect 3 ft @5s NW with stronger 22 mph NW winds, likely blown out. Best: today.
