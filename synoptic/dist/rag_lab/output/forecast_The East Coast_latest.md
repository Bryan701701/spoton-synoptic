Today on the East Coast, conditions are poor with a swell of 4 ft @ 6s SE and fresh 20 mph SE winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a bump to 7 ft @ 8s SE, but with stronger 30 mph SE winds, it's still not looking great. The day after brings a nice change with 3 ft @ 7s ESE and light 3 mph W winds, offering clean and workable conditions at spots like Coldinham Bay. Best: day after.
