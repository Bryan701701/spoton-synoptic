The East Coast is looking good today with 3 ft @ 7s ESE swell and light NNW winds at 3 mph. Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay are both firing, especially during the tide windows from 09:14 to 15:35. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 3 ft @ 6s ESE with SSW winds at 7 mph, still offering fun conditions at the same spots. Day after, expect a quieter day with only 1 ft @ 4s SSE, so it’s best to enjoy the surf today! Best: today.
