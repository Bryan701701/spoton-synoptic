The East Coast is lighting up today with 4 ft @ 7s SE swell and a moderate 11 mph WSW wind. Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay are your best bets, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @ 6s SSE with fresh 25 mph S winds making it poor across the coast. Day after, still 3 ft @ 5s SSE but with easing winds at 15 mph S; some workable corners at Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay. Best: today.
