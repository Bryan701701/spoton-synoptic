Today on the East Coast, it's a bit of a struggle with 3 ft @5s NW swell and fresh 24 mph NW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 3 ft @9s NNE swell but winds slightly easing to 22 mph NNW, still not ideal. Day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @6s NNE with 23 mph NW winds, keeping it choppy. Best: tomorrow.
