Today on the East Coast, conditions are poor with 3 ft @5s SSW swell and fresh 25 mph SW wind, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 3 ft @6s SSE swell and 18 mph SW wind; Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay may offer some workable waves during the mid-tide push. The day after, conditions drop back to poor with similar swell and wind, leaving little to ride. Best: tomorrow.
