Today on the East Coast, it's a bit of a struggle with 2 ft @5s S swell and fresh 22 mph SSW wind creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 3 ft @6s S swell, but the wind remains fresh at 19 mph SW, keeping it messy. By the day after, conditions clean up nicely with 3 ft @7s SSE swell and light 3 mph NE winds, especially at spots like Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay during the mid-tide windows. Best: day after.
