The East Coast is lighting up today with 4 ft @7s SE swell and a moderate 11 mph WSW wind. Best spots are Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay, both offering clean conditions during the tide windows. Tomorrow sees a drop to 3 ft @6s with fresh 25 mph S winds, making it poor across the board. Day after, conditions improve slightly to 3 ft @5s, but still not ideal. Best: today.
