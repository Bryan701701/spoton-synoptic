Today on the East Coast, it's a bit of a washout with fresh SE winds at 28 mph and a hefty 7 ft @ 8s swell, making it blown out and messy. Tomorrow brings a refreshing change with 3 ft @ 7s E swell and light NNW winds at 3 mph, creating clean conditions at spots like St Andrews East. The day after continues the trend with similar 2 ft @ 6s E swell and light SW winds, keeping things fun and manageable. Best: tomorrow.
