Today on the East Coast, it's flat with no surf, as the swell isn't hitting this coast. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with a fresh 30 mph SE wind and a swell bumping up to 7 ft @ 8s, but it'll be blown out and messy. The day after, the wind calms down to 3 mph W, and we see a clean 3 ft @ 7s ESE swell, making for a fun day at spots like Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay. Best: day after.
