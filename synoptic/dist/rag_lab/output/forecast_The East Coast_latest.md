Today on the East Coast, Aberdeen Harbour is lighting up with 2 ft @ 7s NE and light 6 mph WNW winds, making for clean conditions. Tomorrow, conditions drop with similar 2 ft @ 8s but fresh 11 mph WNW winds will make it blown out. The day after, expect a bit more energy with 3 ft @ 9s NE at Aberdeen Harbour, still with light 6 mph NW winds. Best: today.
