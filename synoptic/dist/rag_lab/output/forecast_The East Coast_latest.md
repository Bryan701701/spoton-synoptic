Today on the East Coast, conditions are poor with 3 ft @8s NNE swell and fresh 22 mph WNW wind, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 2 ft @5s N with moderate 12 mph WNW winds, still not producing much. By the day after, the swell remains at 2 ft @7s ENE with light 5 mph W winds, offering a better chance for some clean waves at spots like Dunbar and St Andrews West. Best: day after.
