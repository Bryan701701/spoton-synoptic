The East Coast is looking fun today with Aberdeen Harbour lighting up at 2 ft @ 6s NNE and a moderate 12 mph NW wind. Best conditions are on the push from 08:45 to 15:41. Tomorrow, expect similar 2 ft @ 7s ENE swell with light 4 mph W winds, making it a clean day at spots like Dunbar and St Andrews West. Day after, Aberdeen Harbour holds 2 ft @ 5s NNE with a light 9 mph NW wind, but conditions may be a bit choppy. Best: tomorrow.
