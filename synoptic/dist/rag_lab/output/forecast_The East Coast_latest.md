Today on the East Coast, it's looking fun with 2 ft @5s SSE swell and light SSW winds at 11 mph. Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay are your best bets, especially during the mid-morning and afternoon tides. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 3 ft @5s SSE swell but fresh S winds at 23 mph will make it blown out and poor across the board. Day after, the swell eases back to 2 ft @6s SE with lighter winds, making for a more enjoyable surf day. Best: today.
