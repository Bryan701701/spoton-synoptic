Today on the East Coast, it's a quiet scene with 1 ft @ 6s SSE swell and fresh 17 mph NNW winds. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 3 ft @ 6s NNE swell, but still not ideal as the wind remains at 17 mph NW. Day after brings better conditions with 3 ft @ 6s SSE swell and lighter 12 mph SSW winds, making it the standout day for some fun waves at spots like Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay. Best: day after.
