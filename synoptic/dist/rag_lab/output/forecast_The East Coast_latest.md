Today on the East Coast, it's a no-go with flat conditions—swell isn't hitting this coast and winds are calm. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with a fresh 30 mph SE wind and a stronger swell at 7 ft @ 8s, but it's blown out. The day after brings a welcome change with 3 ft @ 7s ESE swell and light 3 mph W winds, making for clean and fun surf at spots like Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay. Best: day after.
