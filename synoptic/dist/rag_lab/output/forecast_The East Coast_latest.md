Today on the East Coast, Aberdeen Harbour is showing some fun with 3 ft @ 6s NNE and fresh 15 mph NNW winds. It’s a bit choppy, but sheltered corners are working well. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @ 6s SSE with stronger 23 mph S winds, making it blown out and poor. By the day after, we see a nice turnaround with 3 ft @ 7s SE and light 8 mph SSW winds, offering clean and fun surf at spots like Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay. Best: day after.
