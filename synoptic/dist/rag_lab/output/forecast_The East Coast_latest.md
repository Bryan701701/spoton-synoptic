Today on the East Coast, Aberdeen Harbour is lighting up with a clean 2 ft @ 7s NE and light 6 mph WNW winds. Perfect conditions for a fun session, especially between 08:48 and 15:31. Tomorrow, the swell remains at 2 ft @ 8s but the wind picks up to 11 mph WNW, making it less appealing. The day after, expect a bit of a bump to 3 ft @ 9s NE at Aberdeen Harbour, with lighter winds again. Best: today.
