Today on the East Coast, it's a quiet scene with 1 ft @ 7s NNE swell and fresh 13 mph NW winds. Tomorrow, things pick up a bit with 3 ft @ 9s NE swell; Aberdeen Harbour is the standout spot with light winds making it the best choice. The day after sees a drop to 2 ft @ 10s NNE, but with similar fresh winds, conditions remain poor across the board. Best: tomorrow.
