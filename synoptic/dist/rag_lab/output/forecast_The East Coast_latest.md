Today on the East Coast, we've got fun, clean surf at 1 ft @ 7s NE with light 8 mph WSW winds. Check out Dunbar and St Andrews West for the best windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with fresh 23 mph NNW winds making it blown out across the board. Day after, surf picks up to 3 ft @ 8s E with light 4 mph W winds, making for a great day at spots like Coldinham Bay and Dunbar. Best: today.
