The East Coast is lighting up today with 3 ft @ 6s ESE swell and fresh 15 mph ESE winds. Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay are your best bets, with optimal tides from 09:06 to 15:36. Tomorrow, the swell builds slightly to 4 ft @ 7s ESE, still with moderate SE winds, keeping it fun at the same spots. Day after, conditions ease with 3 ft @ 7s ESE and light 6 mph S winds, making for a clean surf day. Best: day after.
