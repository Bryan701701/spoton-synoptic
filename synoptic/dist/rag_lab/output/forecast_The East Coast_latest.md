Today on the East Coast, conditions are poor with 4 ft @7s N swell but fresh 24 mph WNW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 3 ft @7s NNE with 17 mph NW winds; Aberdeen Harbour may offer some workable waves. The day after stays similar with 3 ft @7s NNE and 16 mph WNW winds, still not ideal. Best: tomorrow.
