The East Coast is looking solid today with 4 ft @ 6s S swell at Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay, both holding up well under a fresh 16 mph SSW wind. Best windows are early and mid-day, so catch it before the tide drops. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2 ft @ 4s S across the board, making it a quiet day. Day after brings a slight improvement with 3 ft @ 5s SE, so keep an eye on those sheltered spots. Best: today.
