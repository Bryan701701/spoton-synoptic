Today on the East Coast, it's looking clean with 1 ft @ 7s NE swell and light 8 mph WSW winds. Dunbar and St Andrews West are your best bets, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 4 ft @ 7s E swell but fresh 23 mph NNW winds will make it blown out across the board. Day after, the swell eases to 3 ft @ 8s E with light 4 mph W winds, making for fun, workable surf at spots like Dunbar and Coldinham Bay. Best: today.
