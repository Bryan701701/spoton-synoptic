Today on the East Coast, it's looking fun with 3 ft @ 6s ESE swell and light 5 mph SSW winds. Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay are your top picks, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 5s, making it a quiet day with no standout spots. Day after, the swell picks up to 5 ft @ 6s, but fresh 21 mph SSW winds will likely make it blown out. Best: today.
