The East Coast is looking solid! Today, expect 3 ft @ 6s ESE with fresh 15 mph ESE winds. Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay are your best bets, especially between 09:06 and 15:36. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 4 ft @ 7s ESE, still with 14 mph SE winds; conditions remain fun at the same spots. By the day after, the wind eases to 6 mph S, keeping the 3 ft @ 7s ESE swell clean and enjoyable. Best: day after.
