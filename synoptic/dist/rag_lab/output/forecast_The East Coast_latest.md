Today on the East Coast, conditions are quiet with a weak 2 ft @5s swell and fresh 8 mph SSW winds. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 3 ft @5s SE swell, but the fresh 16 mph SE winds will keep it choppy. By the day after, the swell builds to 4 ft @6s ESE, offering better potential, though the wind remains moderate at 15 mph. Best: day after.
