Today on the East Coast, Aberdeen Harbour is showing some fun with 3 ft @ 6s NNE swell and fresh 15 mph NNW winds. It's a bit choppy, but sheltered corners are working well. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @ 6s SSE with fresh 23 mph S winds, making it blown out and poor. By the day after, things improve with 3 ft @ 7s SE swell and light 8 mph SSW winds, offering clean and fun waves at spots like Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay. Best: day after.
