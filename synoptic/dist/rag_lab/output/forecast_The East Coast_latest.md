Today on the East Coast, surf is up at 4 ft @ 6s from the S with fresh 16 mph SSW winds. Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay are your best bets, with sheltered corners working well during the tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2 ft @ 4s, making it a quiet day across the coast. Day after, surf picks up slightly to 3 ft @ 5s, with lighter SE winds providing a cleaner experience. Best: today.
