Today on the East Coast, it's looking great with 3 ft @7s SSE swell and light 3 mph SW winds. Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay are your top picks, especially during the morning and mid-day tides. Tomorrow drops to 2 ft @7s SE with fresh 8 mph WSW winds, making it less appealing. Day after brings back 3 ft @5s S but with stronger 17 mph SSW winds, so expect some chop. Best: today.
