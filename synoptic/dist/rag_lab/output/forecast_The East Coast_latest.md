Today on the East Coast, it's clean and fun with 2 ft @ 5s E swell and light 6 mph W winds. St Andrews West and Arbroath are the top picks, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, swell builds to 5 ft @ 8s E with fresh 18 mph SSE winds, offering some solid options. The day after, conditions drop to 4 ft @ 6s E, but with 19 mph S winds, it’s looking poor across the board. Best: tomorrow.
