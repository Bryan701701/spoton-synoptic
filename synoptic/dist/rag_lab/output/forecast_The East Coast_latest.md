The East Coast is looking great today with 3 ft @6s S swell and a light 11 mph SSW wind. Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay are your best bets, especially during the morning and early afternoon tides. Tomorrow, conditions take a turn for the worse with fresh 33 mph SSW winds making it blown out and not producing. By the day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @5s, but it's still workable at Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay with light winds. Best: today.
