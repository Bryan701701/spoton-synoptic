Today on the East Coast, conditions are poor with 5 ft @7s ENE swell and a fresh 37 mph ENE wind, making it blown out and unworkable. Tomorrow, the surf improves to 4 ft @8s E with light 5 mph WSW winds, offering clean and fun waves at spots like Coldinham Bay and St Andrews East. The day after continues the trend with 4 ft @6s E swell and light 5 mph WNW winds, keeping the surf friendly at the same locations. Best: tomorrow.
