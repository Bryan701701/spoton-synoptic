Today on the East Coast, Aberdeen Harbour is lighting up with 2 ft @ 6s NNE and a moderate 12 mph NW wind, making for a fun session. Tomorrow, expect similar conditions with 2 ft @ 7s ENE and light 4 mph W winds at spots like Dunbar and St Andrews West, offering clean options. The day after, Aberdeen Harbour holds steady with 2 ft @ 5s NNE and 9 mph NW winds, still workable. Best: tomorrow.
