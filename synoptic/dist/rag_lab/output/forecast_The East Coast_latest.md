Today on the East Coast, conditions are poor with 6 ft @8s SSE swell and fresh 25 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a nice change with 2 ft @7s SE swell and light 3 mph WSW winds, offering clean conditions at spots like Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay. The day after continues with similar 2 ft @6s ESE swell, though the wind picks up to 9 mph SW, making it a bit choppy. Best: tomorrow.
