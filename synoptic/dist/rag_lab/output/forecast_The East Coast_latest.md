Today on the East Coast, it's a quiet one with 2 ft @6s SSE lines and a light 7 mph WSW wind. Tomorrow sees a bit of a bump to 3 ft @5s, but with fresh 14 mph SSW winds, it’ll be a mixed bag—Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay might be your best bets. Day after, similar swell at 3 ft @5s, but winds ease slightly to 10 mph, making it more workable. Best: day after.
