The East Coast is looking good today with 3 ft @6s S swell and 11 mph SSW winds. Check out Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay for the best windows between 08:44–11:31 and 13:01–15:25. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 4 ft @6s S swell but fresh 33 mph SSW winds will make it blown out—best to give it a miss. On the day after, swell eases to 2 ft @5s S with lighter 9 mph S winds, making for a more enjoyable session at sheltered spots like Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay. Best: today.
