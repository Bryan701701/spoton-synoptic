Today on the East Coast, it's a bit rough with 5 ft @6s S swell and fresh 23 mph SSW winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a drop to 3 ft @5s SSW, still with fresh winds, so not much improvement. By the day after, conditions remain similar with 3 ft @6s SSE, but winds ease to 14 mph, offering a slight chance for some fun at spots like Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay. Best: day after.
