Today on the East Coast, it’s a no-go with fresh SE winds at 28 mph and a hefty 7 ft @ 8s swell making it blown out everywhere. Tomorrow, conditions improve with a clean 3 ft @ 7s swell and light NNW winds, making spots like St Andrews East and Coldinham Bay fun for a session. Day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 6s with similar light winds, still workable at sheltered corners. Best: tomorrow.
