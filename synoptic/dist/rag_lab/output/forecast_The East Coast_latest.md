The East Coast is lighting up today with clean 3 ft @7s SSE swell and light 3 mph SW winds. Best spots include Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay, both offering fun conditions during their tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2 ft @7s SE with fresh 8 mph WSW winds, making it less inviting. By the day after, swell picks back up to 3 ft @5s but with stronger 17 mph SSW winds, so expect some chop. Best: today.
