Today on the East Coast, conditions are poor with 6 ft @6s SE swell and fresh 41 mph S winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 6 ft @8s SSE swell and lighter 16 mph S winds, but still not producing well—only Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay may offer some workable corners. The day after brings cleaner conditions with 3 ft @6s SSE and light 5 mph W winds, making for a fun surf day at spots like Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay. Best: day after.
