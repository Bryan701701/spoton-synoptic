Today on the East Coast, Aberdeen Harbour is lighting up with a fun 2 ft @ 11s NNE swell and a light 12 mph W wind, making for clean conditions. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 5s NW with fresh 26 mph NW winds, leading to blown-out surf. The day after, conditions remain poor with 3 ft @ 7s N and 20 mph NNW winds, keeping it messy. Best: today.
