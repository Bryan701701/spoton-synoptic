Today on the East Coast, it's looking fun with clean 4 ft @ 8s E swell and light 5 mph W winds. Spots like Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay are firing, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 6s E with a fresh WNW breeze, making it less exciting, but Dunbar and St Andrews West still have some potential. By the day after, we're back up to 5 ft @ 8s E with light SSW winds, so expect some solid surf at places like Coldinham Bay and St Andrews East. Best: day after.
