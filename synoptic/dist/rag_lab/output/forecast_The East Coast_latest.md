Today on the East Coast, it's looking solid with 4 ft @ 7s ESE swell and fresh 13 mph SSE winds. Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay are your best bets, both working well from mid-morning to afternoon. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 7s with lighter 9 mph S winds, keeping it fun and manageable across the coast. By the day after, expect smaller 2 ft @ 6s with light 4 mph WNW winds, making for a more relaxed session. Best: today.
