Today on the East Coast, it's a bit quiet with 2 ft @5s S swell and 8 mph SSW wind; not producing much. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 3 ft @5s SE swell, but 16 mph SE winds will keep it choppy. By the day after, the swell builds to 4 ft @6s ESE, and while it's still breezy at 15 mph, there are some workable options at spots like Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay. Best: day after.
