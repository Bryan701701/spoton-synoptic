Today on the East Coast, conditions are poor with 3 ft @ 7s NNE swell and fresh 19 mph NW winds. Tomorrow, similar 3 ft @ 7s NNE swell continues but with a bit more wind at 21 mph WNW, making it messy. By the day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 6s NNE with lighter winds at 12 mph NW, still not producing much. Best: today.
