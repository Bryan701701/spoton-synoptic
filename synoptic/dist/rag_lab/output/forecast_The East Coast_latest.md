Today on the East Coast, it's looking good with 3 ft @ 6s ESE swell and light 5 mph SSW winds. Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay are prime spots, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2 ft @ 5s SSE, making it a quiet day across the coast. By the day after, swell picks up to 5 ft @ 6s but with fresh 21 mph SSW winds, likely making it blown out. Best: today.
