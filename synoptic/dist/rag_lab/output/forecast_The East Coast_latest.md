The East Coast is looking solid! Today, expect 3 ft @ 6s ESE with fresh 15 mph ESE winds. Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay are your best bets, especially from 09:06 to 15:36. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 4 ft @ 7s ESE and 14 mph SE winds, still keeping it fun at the same spots. On the day after, surf drops back to 3 ft @ 7s ESE with light 6 mph S winds, making for a clean and enjoyable session. Best: tomorrow.
