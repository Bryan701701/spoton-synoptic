Today on the East Coast, it's a no-go with conditions poor across the board—7 ft @8s SE swell and fresh 28 mph SE winds have it blown out. Tomorrow brings a refreshing change with 3 ft @7s E swell and light 3 mph NNW winds, making for a fun day at spots like St Andrews East. The day after, conditions drop to 2 ft @6s E with similar light winds, still offering some playful surf. Best: tomorrow.
