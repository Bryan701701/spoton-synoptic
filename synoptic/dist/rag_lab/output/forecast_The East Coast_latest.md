Today on the East Coast, it's looking fun with 1 ft @ 7s NE swell and light 8 mph WSW winds. Dunbar and St Andrews West are the top picks, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow brings a fresh 4 ft @ 7s E swell but with 23 mph NNW winds, making it blown out across the region. Day after, conditions improve with 3 ft @ 8s E swell and light 4 mph W winds, offering great opportunities at spots like Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay. Best: day after.
