Today on the East Coast, it's quiet with no surf action—wrong swell angle and fresh 25 mph SSW winds have it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 2 ft @7s SE swell and light 3 mph WSW winds, making for a fun day at spots like Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay. The day after, similar 2 ft @6s ESE swell continues, but winds pick up slightly to 9 mph SW, still offering some workable waves at St Andrews West and Arbroath. Best: tomorrow.
