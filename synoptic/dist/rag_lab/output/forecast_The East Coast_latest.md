Today on the East Coast, it's a bit of a struggle with 4 ft @7s N swell and fresh 24 mph WNW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 3 ft @7s NNE with 17 mph NW winds; Aberdeen Harbour might have some workable moments. The day after stays similar with 3 ft @7s NNE, but winds ease slightly to 16 mph, still mostly poor conditions. Best: tomorrow.
