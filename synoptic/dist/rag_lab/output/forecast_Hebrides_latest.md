Today in the Hebrides, it's a bit of a bummer with fresh 20 mph S winds creating blown-out conditions. The swell is a hefty 8 ft @ 13s from the W, but unfortunately, no spots are working. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 7 ft @ 12s WSW swell and 17 mph ESE winds; some sheltered corners like Barvas and Europie should offer fun waves. By the day after, the swell drops to 4 ft @ 10s WNW with lighter 9 mph ESE winds, making for cleaner surf at spots like Dalbeg and Scarasta. Best: day after.
