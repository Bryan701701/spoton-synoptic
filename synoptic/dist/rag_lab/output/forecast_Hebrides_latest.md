Today in the Hebrides, it's a solid 5 ft @ 11s W with light 5 mph SSE winds. Great conditions at spots like Europie and Barvas, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, expect a drop to 3 ft @ 11s W, still workable but with a bit more wind at 9 mph SSW. The day after, it stays around 3 ft but shifts to 8s WNW with fresh 17 mph ENE winds, so look for sheltered corners. Best: today.
