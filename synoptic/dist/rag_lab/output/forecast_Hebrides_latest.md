Today in the Hebrides, surf is on with clean 3 ft @9s W lines and a light ENE wind at 11 mph. Good spots like Europie and Dalbeg are firing, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, expect similar conditions with 3 ft @11s WNW swell and light E winds, keeping it fun and manageable. By the day after, the swell picks up to 4 ft @11s NW, with light S winds, making for excellent surf at Tolsta and Port of Ness. Best: day after.
