Today in the Hebrides, it's a tough call with 6 ft @11s WSW swell but fresh 30 mph SSE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with 8 ft @7s SSW swell and strong 42 mph S winds; it's definitely not producing. Day after, the swell picks up to 11 ft @10s SW but with even stronger 57 mph SSW winds, making it quite challenging. Best: none.
