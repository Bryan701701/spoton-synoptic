Today in the Hebrides, conditions are poor with 9 ft @10s WSW swell and fresh 28 mph SSW winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 9 ft @12s but the wind remains fresh at 27 mph SSW, keeping it messy. On the day after, the swell increases to 12 ft @9s SSW with strong 50 mph S winds, resulting in very challenging conditions. Best: none.
