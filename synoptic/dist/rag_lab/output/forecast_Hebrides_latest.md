Today in the Hebrides, it's blown out with fresh 45 mph S winds and 9 ft @ 8s SSW swell. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 10 ft @ 9s SW swell and 40 mph SW winds, still not producing. However, day after brings a big change: 10 ft @ 11s NNW swell with light 10 mph NNW winds, offering clean and fun surf at spots like Tolsta and Port of Ness. Best: day after.
