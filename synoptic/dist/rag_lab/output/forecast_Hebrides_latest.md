Today in the Hebrides, it's a bit rough with 7 ft @13s WSW and fresh 20 mph SE winds making it blown out—best to give it a miss. Tomorrow sees a drop to 3 ft @10s WSW, but with 23 mph ESE winds, it's still not producing anything worthwhile. Day after, conditions improve slightly with 6 ft @12s WSW and lighter 13 mph ESE winds at select spots like Europie and Barvas, making it more workable. Best: day after.
