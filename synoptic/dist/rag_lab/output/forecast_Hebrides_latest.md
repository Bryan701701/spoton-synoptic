Today in the Hebrides, it's looking poor with 4 ft @9s NNW swell but fresh 22 mph W winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell increases to 11 ft @10s NNW, but with stronger 34 mph NNW winds, it's still not workable. The day after sees similar conditions with 11 ft @10s N swell and 38 mph N winds, keeping it messy. Best: none.
