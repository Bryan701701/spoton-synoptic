Today in the Hebrides, surf is looking fun with 4 ft @ 9s WSW swell and a light 13 mph SSE wind. Good spots like Europie and Barvas are working well, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 6 ft @ 13s WSW swell but fresh 19 mph ESE winds will make it blown out across the board. The day after brings a hefty 16 ft @ 12s WSW swell with strong 44 mph SW winds, so it’s best to sit this one out. Best: today.
