Today in the Hebrides, it's a bit of a tough one with 8 ft @13s W swell and fresh 20 mph S winds making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees a drop to 7 ft @12s WSW with 17 mph ESE winds, bringing some workable conditions at spots like Europie and Barvas during the mid-tide push. Day after, conditions improve further with 4 ft @10s WNW swell and light 9 mph ESE winds, making for clean surf at places like Dalbeg and Scarasta. Best: day after.
