Today in the Hebrides, conditions are poor with 7 ft @13s WSW swell and fresh 20 mph SE winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow sees a drop to 3 ft @10s with 23 mph ESE winds, still not producing much. The day after, things improve to 6 ft @12s with lighter 13 mph ESE winds, offering some workable options at spots like Europie and Barvas. Best: day after.
