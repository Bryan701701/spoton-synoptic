Today in the Hebrides, it's a bit rough with 7 ft @13s WSW swell and fresh 20 mph SE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @10s, still messy with 23 mph ESE winds. By the day after, conditions improve slightly with 6 ft @12s WSW and lighter 13 mph ESE winds, offering some workable options at spots like Europie and Barvas during the mid-tide. Best: day after.
