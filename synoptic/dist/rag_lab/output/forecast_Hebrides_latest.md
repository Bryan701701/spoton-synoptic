Today in the Hebrides, it's looking great with clean 5 ft @10s NNW swell and light 5 mph NE winds. Spots like Tolsta and Port of Ness are firing, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, expect a bump to 6 ft @9s WSW with fresh 16 mph SSW winds, making it a bit choppy, but still workable at places like Europie and Barvas. By the day after, the swell peaks at 9 ft @12s WSW, but strong 22 mph S winds will make it blown out across the board. Best: today.
