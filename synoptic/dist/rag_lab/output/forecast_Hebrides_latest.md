Today in the Hebrides, surf is fun at 4 ft @ 8s NNW with a fresh 15 mph W wind. Good spots like Tolsta and Port of Ness are working well, especially around mid-tide. Tomorrow, conditions take a hit with 5 ft @ 8s NNW but a strong 26 mph N wind will make it blown out. Day after, Europie and Barvas light up with 5 ft @ 9s W and light 8 mph WSW winds, offering a great surf day. Best: day after.
