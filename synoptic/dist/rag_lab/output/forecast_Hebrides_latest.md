Today in the Hebrides, conditions are poor with a hefty 15 ft @ 11s WSW swell and fresh 47 mph SW winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 10 ft @ 10s with 40 mph S winds, still not producing anything worthwhile. Day after, the swell picks up a bit to 11 ft @ 13s but remains messy with 33 mph SSW winds. Best: none.
