Today in the Hebrides, it’s a bit rough with 9 ft @16s W swell and fresh 27 mph ESE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 5 ft @12s W swell and 17 mph ESE winds, but still not ideal—sheltered spots like Dalbeg and Europie might have some workable waves. Day after, the swell drops to 4 ft @10s WSW with similar winds, keeping it on the lower end. Best: tomorrow.
