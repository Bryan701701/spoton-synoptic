Today in the Hebrides, it's a bit of a struggle with poor conditions: 8 ft @13s W swell and fresh 20 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 7 ft @12s WSW swell and 17 mph ESE winds, but still not ideal—sheltered spots like Barvas and Dalbeg may be your best bet. By the day after, conditions get much better with 4 ft @10s WNW swell and light 9 mph ESE winds, making it a great day for a surf at spots like Europie and Scarasta. Best: day after.
