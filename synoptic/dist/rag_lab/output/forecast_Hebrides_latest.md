Today in the Hebrides, it's a great day for surfing with clean 4 ft @ 12s N swell and light 6 mph SE winds. Spots like Tolsta and Port of Ness are firing, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 5 ft @ 9s NNW swell and fresh 23 mph W winds, making it poor across the board. The day after, it ramps up to 12 ft @ 10s NNW with strong 32 mph NNW winds, likely blown out. Best: today.
