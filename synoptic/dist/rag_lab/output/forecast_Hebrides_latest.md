Today in the Hebrides, conditions are challenging with 13 ft @14s WSW swell and fresh 31 mph SW winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 12 ft @14s with similar fresh winds, keeping it messy. By the day after, the swell decreases further to 8 ft @10s, but the SSE winds will still create rough conditions. Best: none.
