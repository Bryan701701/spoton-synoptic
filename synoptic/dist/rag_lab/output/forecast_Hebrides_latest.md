Today in the Hebrides, it's a tough call with 9 ft @8s SSW swell and fresh 45 mph S winds making for blown-out conditions. Tomorrow sees a slight increase to 10 ft @9s SW, but the winds remain strong at 40 mph SW, keeping it messy. On the bright side, the day after brings cleaner conditions with a solid 10 ft @11s NNW swell and light 10 mph NNW winds, perfect for a surf session at spots like Tolsta or Port of Ness. Best: day after.
