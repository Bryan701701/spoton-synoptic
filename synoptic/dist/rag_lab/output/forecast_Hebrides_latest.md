Today in the Hebrides, surf is looking fun with 3 ft @ 9s W and fresh 11 mph ENE winds. Good spots like Europie and Dalbeg are firing, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions improve with a longer period swell at 3 ft @ 11s WNW and light 5 mph E winds, making for clean lines. By the day after, we see a solid 4 ft @ 11s NW swell with light 2 mph S winds, perfect for a surf session at Tolsta or Port of Ness. Best: tomorrow.
