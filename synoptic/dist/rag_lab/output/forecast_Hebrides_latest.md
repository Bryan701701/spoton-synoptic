Today in the Hebrides, it's looking poor with 9 ft @10s WSW swell but fresh 26 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow stays similar with the same swell and wind conditions, so it won't improve. The day after also brings 9 ft @11s WSW swell, but with slightly easing winds at 24 mph SSW; still not ideal. Best: none.
