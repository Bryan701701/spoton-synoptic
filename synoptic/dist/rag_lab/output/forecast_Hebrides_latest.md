Today in the Hebrides, it's a no-go with 10 ft @10s SW swell and fresh 37 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight increase to 12 ft @15s WSW, but the wind remains strong at 32 mph S, keeping conditions poor. Day after, still 12 ft @13s WSW with 36 mph SSW winds, so expect more of the same. Best: none.
