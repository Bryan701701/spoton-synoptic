Today in the Hebrides, surf is looking good with 4 ft @ 9s WSW and a light 13 mph SSE wind. Sheltered corners like Europie and Barvas are working well, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 6 ft @ 13s WSW but fresh 19 mph ESE winds will make it blown out. The day after, expect a hefty 16 ft @ 12s WSW with strong 44 mph SW winds, making it poor for surfing. Best: today.
