Today in the Hebrides, it’s a bit rough with 8 ft @13s W swell and fresh 20 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 7 ft @12s WSW swell and 17 mph ESE winds; some sheltered spots like Barvas and Dalbeg might be workable. The day after brings cleaner conditions with 4 ft @10s WNW swell and light 9 mph ESE winds, making it a fun day at spots like Europie and Scarasta. Best: day after.
