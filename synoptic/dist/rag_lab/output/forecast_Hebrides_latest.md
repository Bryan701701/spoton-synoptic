Today in the Hebrides, it's a solid day with 5 ft @ 11s W swell and light 5 mph SSE winds. Europie and Barvas are both firing, offering fun conditions from mid-morning into the afternoon. Tomorrow sees a drop to 3 ft @ 11s W with 9 mph SSW winds, still workable at spots like Dalbeg and Dalmore. Day after, swell holds at 3 ft but shifts to 8s with fresh 17 mph ENE winds, making it a bit choppy. Best: today.
