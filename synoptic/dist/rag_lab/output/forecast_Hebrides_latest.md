Today in the Hebrides, it’s a no-go with poor conditions; 8 ft @13s W swell is met with fresh 20 mph S winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 7 ft @12s WSW swell and 17 mph ESE winds, but still not ideal. By the day after, conditions turn good with 4 ft @10s WNW swell and light 9 mph ESE winds, making for a fun surf day. Best: day after.
