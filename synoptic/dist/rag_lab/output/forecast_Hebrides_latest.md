Today in the Hebrides, conditions are poor with 8 ft @9s N swell and fresh 29 mph NNW winds. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 6 ft @9s N, but the wind remains fresh at 27 mph, keeping it blown out. On the day after, the swell eases to 5 ft @7s NW with lighter 16 mph NW winds, offering some workable options at spots like Tolsta and Port of Ness. Best: day after.
