Today in the Hebrides, it's looking poor with 8 ft @9s N swell and fresh 29 mph NNW winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 6 ft @9s N and 27 mph N winds, still not producing. However, the day after sees a slight improvement with 5 ft @7s NW and lighter 16 mph NW winds, making it more workable around mid-tide. Best: day after.
