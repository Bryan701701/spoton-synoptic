Today in the Hebrides, it's a bit rough with 7 ft @8s NNW swell and fresh 30 mph N wind—definitely blown out. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 5 ft @9s W with 21 mph W wind, still not producing much. The day after holds similar conditions with 5 ft @10s W and 21 mph SW wind, keeping it messy. Best: none.
