Today in the Hebrides, it's looking solid with 5 ft @12s W swell and light 5 mph SSE winds. Good spots like Europie and Barvas are working well, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 5 ft @11s W with a slight increase in wind to 12 mph S, keeping the surf fun at the same spots. By the day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @11s W, still offering some playful waves at sheltered corners like Dalbeg and Dalmore. Best: today.
