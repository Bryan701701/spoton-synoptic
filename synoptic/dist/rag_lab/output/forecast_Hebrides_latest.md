Today in the Hebrides, surf is looking solid with 4 ft @ 9s WSW swell and a light 13 mph SSE wind. Good spots like Europie and Barvas are working well, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 6 ft @ 13s WSW but with fresh 19 mph ESE winds, making it blown out across the board. The day after, the swell ramps up to a hefty 16 ft @ 12s WSW with strong 44 mph SW winds, so best to sit this one out. Best: today.
