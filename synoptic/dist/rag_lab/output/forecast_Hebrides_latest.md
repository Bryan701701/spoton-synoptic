Today in the Hebrides, it's a solid 6 ft @ 8s W with light 7 mph SW winds. Europie and Barvas are looking great, especially around mid-tide. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 5 ft @ 10s W, with moderate 11 mph SSE winds, but still plenty of fun at spots like Europie and Bus Stop. On the day after, expect 6 ft @ 10s WNW with light 7 mph SE winds, keeping conditions clean and enjoyable. Best: today.
