Today in the Hebrides, it’s a bit rough with 9 ft @16s W swell and fresh 27 mph ESE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a drop to 5 ft @12s W with similar winds, but some sheltered spots like Europie and Barvas may offer workable conditions. The day after, it continues to ease with 4 ft @10s WSW swell and 17 mph S winds, still best at those same corners. Best: tomorrow.
