Today in the Hebrides, it's a bit of a struggle with 8 ft @ 13s W swell and fresh 20 mph S winds making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 7 ft @ 12s WSW swell and ESE winds at 17 mph, offering some workable conditions at spots like Europie and Barvas. By the day after, conditions clean up nicely with 4 ft @ 10s WNW swell and light 9 mph ESE winds, making it a great day to hit the water at spots like Dalbeg and Scarasta. Best: day after.
