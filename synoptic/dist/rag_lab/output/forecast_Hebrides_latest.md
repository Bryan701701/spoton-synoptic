Today in the Hebrides, surf is looking solid with 6 ft @ 13s WSW swell and fresh 13 mph SSE winds. Good spots like Europie and Barvas are working well, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @ 9s, still offering some fun waves, but with a consistent S wind. On the day after, conditions take a downturn with 6 ft @ 12s SW swell and fresh 25 mph E winds, making it poor across the board. Best: today.
