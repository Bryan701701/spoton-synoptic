Today in the Hebrides, it's looking solid with 6 ft @ 13s WSW swell and a light 13 mph SSE wind. Good spots like Europie and Barvas are working well, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @ 9s, but still offers fun conditions at the same spots. On the day after, expect poor conditions with 6 ft @ 12s SW swell, but fresh 25 mph E winds will make it blown out. Best: today.
