Today in the Hebrides, conditions are poor with 12 ft @12s WSW swell and fresh 35 mph SSW winds; it’s blown out across all spots. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 9 ft @12s with 25 mph SSW winds, still not producing clean surf. The day after remains similar with 9 ft @12s and 26 mph SSW winds; expect continued choppy conditions. Best: none.
