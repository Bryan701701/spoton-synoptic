Today in the Hebrides, you're looking at fun 3 ft @ 11s NW swell with light 3 mph SE winds. Tolsta and Port of Ness are both clean and workable, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell builds slightly to 4 ft @ 11s NW with similar light winds, making it another great day at the same spots. On the day after, conditions remain solid with 4 ft @ 12s N swell and light SSE winds, keeping the surf lively. Best: tomorrow.
