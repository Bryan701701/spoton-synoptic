Today in the Hebrides, we have solid conditions with 5 ft @ 12s W swell and fresh 17 mph ESE winds. Good spots like Europie and Barvas are working well, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 9s WSW with moderate 11 mph S winds, still offering fun waves at spots like Dalbeg and Scarasta. By the day after, conditions improve again with 6 ft @ 12s W swell and light 6 mph ENE winds, making it a great day for surf at all the usual spots. Best: day after.
