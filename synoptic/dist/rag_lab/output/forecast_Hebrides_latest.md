Today in the Hebrides, surf is looking solid at 6 ft @ 13s WSW with fresh 13 mph SSE winds. Good spots like Europie and Barvas are working well, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @ 9s, still offering some fun waves but less power. By the day after, conditions deteriorate with strong 25 mph E winds making it blown out across the board. Best: today.
