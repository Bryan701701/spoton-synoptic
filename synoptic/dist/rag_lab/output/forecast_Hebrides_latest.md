Today in the Hebrides, we have solid conditions with 4 ft @ 8s NNW swell and a fresh 15 mph W wind. Good spots like Tolsta and Port of Ness are working well, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 5 ft @ 8s NNW but with a strong 26 mph N wind, making it poor across the board. On the day after, expect 5 ft @ 9s W swell with light 8 mph WSW winds, offering cleaner surf at spots like Europie and Barvas. Best: today.
