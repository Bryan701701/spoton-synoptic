Today in the Hebrides, it's looking solid with 5 ft @ 12s W swell and light 5 mph SSE winds. Great conditions at spots like Europie and Barvas, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 5 ft @ 11s W but winds pick up to 12 mph S, still offering fun waves at the same spots. On the day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 11s W with 8 mph SW winds, but still workable at sheltered corners like Dalbeg. Best: today.
