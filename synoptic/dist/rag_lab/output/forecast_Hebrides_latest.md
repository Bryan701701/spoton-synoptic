Today in the Hebrides, it's a bit rough with 11 ft @12s WSW swell and fresh 34 mph S winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees a slight increase to 13 ft @14s WSW, but the same strong winds will keep it messy. On the day after, the swell drops to 10 ft @11s WSW with 25 mph SSW winds, still not ideal. Best: none.
