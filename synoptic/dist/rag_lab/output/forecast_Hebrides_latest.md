Today in the Hebrides, we're looking at solid surf with 6 ft @8s W swell and light 7 mph SW winds. Best spots include Europie and Barvas, both working well throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 5 ft @10s W with 11 mph SSE winds, still offering good conditions at the same locations. By the day after, expect 6 ft @10s WNW with light SE winds, keeping the fun going. Best: today.
