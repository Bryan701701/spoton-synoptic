Today in the Hebrides, it's a bit of a bummer with 4 ft @9s S swell, but fresh 23 mph ESE winds are making it messy across the board—sheltered corners aren't working. Tomorrow, things turn around nicely with a solid 6 ft @12s SW swell and light 11 mph SE winds, making for clean conditions at spots like Dalmore and Europie. The day after, expect 5 ft @10s WSW swell with moderate 14 mph SW winds—still decent but a touch choppy. Best: tomorrow.
