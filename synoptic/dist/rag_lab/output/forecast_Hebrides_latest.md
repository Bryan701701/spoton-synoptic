Today in the Hebrides, it’s looking poor with 5 ft @9s WSW swell but fresh 20 mph SE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 8 ft @14s W swell and lighter 14 mph SE winds, offering some workable options at spots like Dalmore and Scarasta. Day after, the swell drops to 4 ft @9s SW, but wind picks up to 21 mph ESE, keeping it messy across the board. Best: tomorrow.
