Today in the Hebrides, it's a challenging surf day with 13 ft @14s WSW swell and fresh 31 mph SW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 12 ft @14s, but the conditions remain poor with similar fresh winds. On the day after, the swell continues to decrease to 8 ft @10s, still with fresh SSE winds, keeping it messy. Best: day after.
