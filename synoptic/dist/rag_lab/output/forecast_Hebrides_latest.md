Today in the Hebrides, conditions are poor with 9 ft @10s WSW swell and fresh 28 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, similar conditions persist with 9 ft @12s WSW swell and 27 mph SSW winds, keeping it messy. The day after, the swell increases to 12 ft @9s SSW but is accompanied by strong 50 mph S winds, making it unworkable. Best: none.
