Today in the Hebrides, it's a bit of a bummer with 4 ft @9s S swell and fresh 23 mph ESE winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow, things pick up nicely with 6 ft @12s SW swell and light 11 mph SE winds, making it a great day for surf at spots like Dalmore and Europie. The day after, the swell drops slightly to 5 ft @10s WSW with moderate 14 mph SW winds, still offering some fun waves. Best: tomorrow.
