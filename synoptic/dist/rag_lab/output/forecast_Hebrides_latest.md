Today, the Hebrides are experiencing blown-out conditions with 9 ft @10s WSW swell and fresh 26 mph SSW winds. Tomorrow looks similar, with the same swell and wind strength, keeping it messy. Day after, swell remains at 9 ft but with a slight increase in period to 11s, still under fresh SSW winds. Best: none.
