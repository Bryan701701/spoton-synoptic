Today in the Hebrides, it's looking great with clean 5 ft @10s NNW swell and light 5 mph NE winds. Spots like Tolsta and Port of Ness are firing, especially during their prime tides. Tomorrow, we see a bump to 6 ft @9s WSW with fresh 16 mph SSW winds, making it a bit choppy but still fun at places like Europie and Barvas. By the day after, conditions worsen with 9 ft @12s WSW swell and strong 22 mph S winds, leading to blown-out surf across the region. Best: today.
