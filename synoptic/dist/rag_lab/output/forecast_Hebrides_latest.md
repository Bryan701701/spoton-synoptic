Today in the Hebrides, we’re looking at solid surf with 6 ft @ 8s W and light 7 mph SW winds. Best spots include Europie and Barvas, both working well throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 5 ft @ 10s W with a moderate 11 mph SSE wind, still offering good conditions at the same locations. Day after, we see a return to 6 ft @ 10s WNW with light 7 mph SE winds, making for a fun surf day. Best: today.
