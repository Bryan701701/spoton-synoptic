Today in the Hebrides, it’s a no-go with 11 ft @9s SSW swell and fresh 49 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with 15 ft @15s WSW swell and 32 mph SW winds—still not looking good. Day after, the swell drops slightly to 12 ft @14s WSW with 20 mph SW winds, but it remains poor overall. Best: none.
