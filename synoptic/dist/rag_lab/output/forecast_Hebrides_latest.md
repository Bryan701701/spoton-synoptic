Today in the Hebrides, surf is looking solid at 3 ft @ 11s W with light 10 mph SW winds. Good spots like Europie and Barvas are working well, especially during the mid-morning and early afternoon tides. Tomorrow, conditions shift slightly with 3 ft @ 10s W and fresh 14 mph ENE winds, making it a bit choppy but still surfable at spots like Dalbeg and Dalmore. By the day after, we see a nice drop in wind to 5 mph ESE, with 3 ft @ 9s NW swell returning, making for clean conditions at Tolsta and Port of Ness. Best: today.
