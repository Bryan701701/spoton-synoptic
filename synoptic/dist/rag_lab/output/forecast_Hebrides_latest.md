Today in the Hebrides, it's a tough call with 11 ft @12s WSW swell and fresh 34 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell increases slightly to 13 ft @14s WSW with similar strong winds, keeping conditions poor. On the day after, the swell drops to 10 ft @11s WSW, but the fresh SSW winds continue to disrupt the surf. Best: none.
