Today in the Hebrides, conditions are poor with a hefty 12 ft @ 12s WSW swell, but fresh 35 mph SSW winds are making it blown out across all spots. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 9 ft @ 12s, but the wind remains fresh at 25 mph SSW, keeping it messy. The day after holds similar conditions with 9 ft @ 12s and 26 mph SSW winds, still not ideal. Best: none.
