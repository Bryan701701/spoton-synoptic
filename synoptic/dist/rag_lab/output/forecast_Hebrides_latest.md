Today in the Hebrides, surf's looking solid with 3 ft @ 11s W and a light 10 mph SW wind. Good spots like Europie and Barvas are working well, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions ease slightly with 3 ft @ 10s W and a fresh 14 mph ENE wind, making it a bit choppy but still rideable at places like Dalbeg and Dalmore. By the day after, we see a nice drop in wind to 5 mph ESE, with 3 ft @ 9s NW swell lighting up spots like Tolsta and Port of Ness. Best: today.
