Today in the Hebrides, conditions are poor with 9 ft @12s WSW swell and fresh 27 mph SW winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees an increase to 11 ft @9s with strong 45 mph S winds, continuing the messy trend. The day after brings even bigger surf at 15 ft @15s, but the wind remains fresh at 34 mph SW, keeping it challenging. Best: none.
