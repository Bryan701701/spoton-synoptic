Today on the Dingle Peninsula, conditions are poor with a strong 41 mph SSE wind and a hefty 12 ft @9s SSW swell, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, the swell remains at 12 ft but shifts to a more manageable 14s W with light 5 mph SW winds, offering some clean options at spots like Ballybunion Left and Garywilliam Point during the mid-morning tide. The day after, conditions improve further with a 7 ft @12s WNW swell and light 6 mph NE winds, providing fun waves at Ballybunion and Mossies. Best: day after.
