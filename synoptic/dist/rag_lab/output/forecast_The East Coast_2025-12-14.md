Today on the East Coast, it's a bit of a bummer with 3 ft @6s S swell and fresh 23 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, things brighten up with 3 ft @7s SSE and light 1 mph NE winds, creating clean conditions at spots like Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay. The day after, we see a slight drop to 2 ft @7s SE, but with light 4 mph WNW winds, it should still be fun at the same spots. Best: tomorrow.
