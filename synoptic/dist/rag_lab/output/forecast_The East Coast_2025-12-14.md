Today on the East Coast, it's a bit of a struggle with fresh 23 mph SSW winds making it blown out. The swell is 3 ft @ 6s from the S, but conditions aren't favorable. Tomorrow looks much better with 3 ft @ 7s SSE and light 1 mph NE winds, especially at spots like Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay. The day after continues the trend with 2 ft @ 7s SE and light 4 mph WNW winds, keeping things fun at the same spots. Best: tomorrow.
