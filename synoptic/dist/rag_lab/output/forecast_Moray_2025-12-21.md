Today in Moray, it's a quiet scene with 1 ft @5s ESE swell and fresh 18 mph ESE winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 2 ft @5s E swell, still with 13 mph ESE winds, but Spey Bay and Lossiemouth might offer some workable corners. The day after, conditions remain similar with 2 ft @6s E swell and lighter 7 mph SE winds, but still not producing much. Best: tomorrow.
