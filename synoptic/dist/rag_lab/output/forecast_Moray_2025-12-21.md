Today in Moray, it's a quiet day with 1 ft @5s ESE swell and fresh 18 mph ESE winds. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 2 ft @5s E swell and moderate 13 mph ESE winds at spots like Spey Bay and Lossiemouth, offering some workable waves. The day after, the swell remains at 2 ft @6s E, but with lighter 7 mph SE winds, still not ideal. Best: tomorrow.
