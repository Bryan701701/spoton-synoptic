Today in Moray, it's a bit of a bummer with flat conditions—1 ft @5s ESE and fresh 18 mph ESE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, we see a slight improvement with 2 ft @5s E swell at Lossiemouth and Spey Bay, but still on the choppy side with 13 mph ESE winds. The day after, similar 2 ft @6s E swell persists, but winds ease to 7 mph SE, keeping it workable at sheltered spots. Best: tomorrow.
