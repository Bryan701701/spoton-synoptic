Today in Donegal, Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are clean and fun with 2 ft @ 11s NW and light E winds at 5 mph. Great conditions for a surf session from early morning until late afternoon. Tomorrow, expect a bump to 3 ft @ 6s NW with fresh NNW winds at 9 mph, making for some exciting waves at spots like Rossnowlagh and Mullaghmore Strand. On the day after, conditions remain solid with similar swell and lighter winds, but watch for some stronger gusts at other spots. Best: tomorrow.
