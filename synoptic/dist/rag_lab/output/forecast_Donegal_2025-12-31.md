Today in Donegal, it's looking good with clean 2 ft @ 11s NW swell and light 5 mph E winds. Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are prime spots, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 3 ft @ 6s NW with a moderate 15 mph NNW wind, making for some fun conditions at places like Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand. Day after, expect similar 3 ft @ 6s NW but with fresh 25 mph N winds, which might make it a bit challenging. Best: tomorrow.
