Today in Donegal, it's looking solid with 6 ft @8s N swell and fresh 14 mph N winds. Pollan Bay and Ballyheiran Bay are among the best spots, offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, expect a drop to 3 ft @5s WNW with fresh 14 mph SW winds, but Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand should still be workable. By the day after, conditions improve with 3 ft @8s WNW and light 6 mph NW winds, making it a great time to hit Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand again. Best: today.
