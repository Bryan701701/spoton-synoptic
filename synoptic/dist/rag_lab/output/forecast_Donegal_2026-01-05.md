Today in Donegal, we’re looking at solid conditions with 6 ft @ 8s N swell and fresh 14 mph N winds. Pollan Bay and Ballyheiran Bay are both working well, especially from 08:55 to 16:17. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 5s WNW with fresh 14 mph SW winds, making Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand your best bets. Day after, expect similar 3 ft @ 8s WNW with lighter 6 mph NW winds, perfect for a fun session at Rossnowlagh or Mullaghmore Strand. Best: today.
