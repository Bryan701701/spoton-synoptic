Today, the South is quiet with 2 ft @5s E swell and fresh 21 mph NE winds, making it a bit blown out. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with 4 ft @6s E swell and even stronger 25 mph ENE winds, keeping it messy. Day after, the swell drops slightly to 3 ft @6s E, but the 23 mph NE winds continue to chop it up. Best: day after.
