Today in The South, it's a no-go with 4 ft @8s SW swell and fresh 24 mph WSW wind creating a blown-out mess. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with 8 ft @7s S swell and strong 36 mph S winds, making it another day to skip. However, the day after brings a nice turnaround with 3 ft @9s SSW swell and light 7 mph SE winds, offering clean conditions at spots like Ballinskelligs Bay. Best: day after.
