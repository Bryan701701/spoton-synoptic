Today, the South is lighting up with 5 ft @ 8s SSW swell and fresh 14 mph SSW winds. Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane are prime spots, especially from 08:43 to 16:54. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 8s with 15 mph NNW winds, still workable at the same spots. By the day after, conditions improve with 3 ft @ 8s and light 4 mph SE winds, making it a great day for a surf session. Best: today.
