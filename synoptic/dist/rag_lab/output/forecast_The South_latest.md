Today is looking fun at The South with clean 2 ft @8s SSW swell and light 8 mph NW winds. Derrynane and Barley Cove are your best bets, both offering solid windows from morning through the afternoon. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 6 ft @7s SSW swell but fresh 35 mph SSW winds will make it blown out across the region. By the day after, we see a slight improvement with 4 ft @7s SSW swell and lighter 15 mph S winds, making it more workable. Best: today.
