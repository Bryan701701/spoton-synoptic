Today, the South coast is quiet with a 4 ft @ 6s E swell, but fresh 25 mph ENE winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 6s ESE, with similar fresh winds at 24 mph, keeping conditions poor. The day after, the swell remains at 3 ft but shortens to 5s, with winds picking up to 30 mph ENE, continuing the trend of challenging surf. Best: today.
