Today, the South is quiet with no surf action—swell isn’t getting in and the fresh 29 mph WSW wind is blowing it out. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with a 4 ft @9s SSW swell and lighter 13 mph SSE winds, making it workable at sheltered spots. Day after, the swell picks up to 7 ft @9s SSW but remains blown out with 26 mph SW winds. Best: tomorrow.
