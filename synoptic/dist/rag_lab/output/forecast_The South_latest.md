Today in The South, conditions are poor with a hefty 7 ft @ 8s SSW swell and fresh 33 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, things improve significantly with a clean 5 ft @ 8s SSW swell and light 3 mph NNE winds, perfect for catching some fun waves at spots like Ballinskelligs Bay. The day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 8s SSW with moderate 13 mph WNW winds, making it workable at a few locations but generally less exciting. Best: tomorrow.
