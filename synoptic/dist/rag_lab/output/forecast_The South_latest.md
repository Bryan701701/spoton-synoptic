Today, the South is quiet with 3 ft @6s ESE swell, but fresh 19 mph ESE winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2 ft @5s ESE with moderate 15 mph NNE winds, still not producing much. The day after stays similar with 2 ft @5s ESE and fresh 21 mph E winds, keeping the surf poor. Best: today.
