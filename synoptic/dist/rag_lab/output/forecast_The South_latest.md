Today, the South is lighting up with clean 2 ft @9s SW swell and light 10 mph WNW winds. Spots like Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane are prime for fun sessions from 08:45 to 16:50. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2 ft @7s WSW with fresh 16 mph NW winds, making it poor across the board. On the day after, expect 4 ft @6s S swell, but with the same fresh winds, it’ll be workable mainly at sheltered spots like Inchydoney. Best: today.
