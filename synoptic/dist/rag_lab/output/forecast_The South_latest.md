Today, the South is quiet with 2 ft @7s SW swell and light 5 mph NNW winds; not producing much. Tomorrow, conditions improve significantly with 3 ft @9s SW swell and light 9 mph WNW winds, making for a fun day at spots like Ballinskelligs Bay. The day after, the swell drops back to 2 ft @8s SW with fresh 18 mph W winds, leading to blown-out conditions. Best: tomorrow.
