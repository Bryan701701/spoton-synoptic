Today in the South, conditions are poor with a hefty swell of 11 ft @ 9s from the S, but fresh 37 mph S winds have it blown out. Tomorrow, the surf improves to 5 ft @ 10s SSW with lighter 13 mph SW winds, making it a workable day at spots like Ballinskelligs Bay. The day after sees a drop to 8 ft @ 8s SSW, but fresh 27 mph SSW winds will keep it messy. Best: tomorrow.
