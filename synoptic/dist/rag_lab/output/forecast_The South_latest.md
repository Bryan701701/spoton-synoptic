Today, the South is looking good with 4 ft @8s SSW swell and a fresh 14 mph S wind. Spots like Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane are clean and fun, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 5 ft @9s SSW with a moderate 16 mph SW wind, keeping things lively at the same spots. Day after, conditions turn poor with 10 ft @9s S swell and strong 40 mph S winds—definitely a day to sit out. Best: tomorrow.
