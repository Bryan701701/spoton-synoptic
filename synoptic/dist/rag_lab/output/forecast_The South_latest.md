Today, the South is seeing 5 ft @7s SSW swell, but fresh 35 mph SSW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with the same swell size at 5 ft @9s, but winds ease slightly to 26 mph S. The day after, the swell holds at 5 ft @8s SSW with 28 mph W winds, keeping it messy. Best: tomorrow.
