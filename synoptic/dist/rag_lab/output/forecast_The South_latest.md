Today in The South, it’s looking solid with 3 ft @ 8s SSW swell and fresh 14 mph WSW winds. Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane are great picks, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 8s SW with light 4 mph NW winds, making for a fun, clean day at spots like Derrynane and Barley Cove. The day after, expect poor conditions with 3 ft @ 7s SSW and strong 35 mph SSW winds, likely blowing out the surf. Best: today.
