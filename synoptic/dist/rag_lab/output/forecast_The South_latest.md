Today, the South is quiet with no surf, as the swell isn't getting in and the wind's fresh at 29 mph WSW. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 4 ft @9s SSW swell and lighter 13 mph SSE winds, making it workable at spots like Ballinskelligs Bay. The day after, the swell picks up to 7 ft @9s SSW, but fresh 26 mph SW winds will likely blow it out. Best: tomorrow.
