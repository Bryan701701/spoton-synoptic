Today, the South is quiet with a weak 2 ft @5s SE swell and fresh 11 mph E winds, making for blown-out conditions. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 1 ft @7s S at Strand, offering a fun option despite the moderate NW wind. The day after returns to poor conditions with 1 ft @6s S across the board, continuing the trend of minimal surf. Best: tomorrow.
