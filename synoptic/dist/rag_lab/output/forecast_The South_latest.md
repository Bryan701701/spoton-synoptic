Today in The South, conditions are poor with 3 ft @ 7s SSW swell and fresh 25 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight increase to 6 ft @ 7s SSW, but the wind remains the same, keeping it messy. By the day after, things improve significantly with 5 ft @ 8s SSW and light 10 mph NW winds, offering clean surf at spots like Ballinskelligs Bay. Best: day after.
