Today, the South is quiet with a weak 1 ft @6s W swell and fresh 17 mph NNW winds, making for a blown-out situation. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 0 ft, leaving the coast flat and unworkable. On the day after, the swell returns to 1 ft @6s SW, but with fresh 18 mph WNW winds, it remains messy. Best: today.
