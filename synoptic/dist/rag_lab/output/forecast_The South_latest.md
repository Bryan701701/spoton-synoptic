Today, the South has clean, small surf at 1ft @8s SW, with light 5 mph WSW winds. Derrynane and Barley Cove are your best bets, both offering fun conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 7ft @7s SSW swell and fresh 25 mph SSW winds, making it poor across the board. On the day after, things improve to 4ft @8s SSW with moderate 14 mph SW winds, offering workable waves at several spots. Best: day after.
