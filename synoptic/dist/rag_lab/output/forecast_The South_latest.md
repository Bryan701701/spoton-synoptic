Today, the South is quiet with no surf action—wrong swell angle and fresh onshore winds at 37 mph. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 5 ft @10s SSW swell and lighter 13 mph SW winds, making it workable at spots like Ballinskelligs Bay. The day after, surf drops to 8 ft @8s SSW but remains blown out with 27 mph SSW winds. Best: tomorrow.
