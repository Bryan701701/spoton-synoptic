Today is a bit quiet across The South with 2 ft @5s E swell and fresh 21 mph NE winds, making for a blown-out session. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 4 ft @6s E swell, but the fresh 25 mph ENE winds will keep it messy. By the day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @6s E with 23 mph NE winds, still not ideal. Best: tomorrow.
