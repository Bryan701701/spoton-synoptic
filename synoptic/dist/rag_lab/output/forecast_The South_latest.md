Today, the South is lighting up with 2 ft @9s SSW swell and fresh 15 mph NW winds. Derrynane and Barley Cove are your best bets, with workable conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 1 ft @6s, making it a quiet day across the coast. The day after continues the trend with similar 1 ft @6s, so best to hold off. Best: today.
