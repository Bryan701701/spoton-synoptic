Today, the South coast is quiet with 5 ft @7s SSW swell, but fresh 35 mph SSW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 5 ft @9s SSW swell and 26 mph S winds, still not producing any workable waves. The day after, the swell drops slightly to 5 ft @8s SSW with 28 mph W winds, keeping it poor across the region. Best: day after.
