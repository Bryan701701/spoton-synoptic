Today in The South, it's looking good with 4 ft @8s SSW swell and light 9 mph SW winds. Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane are prime spots, both best from 09:27 to 17:32. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @8s with fresh 14 mph W winds, still workable at sheltered corners like Ballinskelligs Bay. Day after, conditions worsen with 4 ft @8s SW swell but 19 mph W winds making it blown out. Best: today.
