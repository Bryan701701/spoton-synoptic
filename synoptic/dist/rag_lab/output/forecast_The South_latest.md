Today, the South is quiet with a weak 2 ft @5s ESE swell and fresh 21 mph E wind, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 2 ft @6s SE swell and lighter 7 mph NE winds, but still not producing much. By the day after, conditions brighten up with 1 ft @6s SSE swell and light 6 mph WNW winds, offering a little fun at Strand during the tide window. Best: day after.
