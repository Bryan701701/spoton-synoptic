Today in the South, conditions are poor with 4 ft @8s SW swell, but fresh 24 mph WSW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell increases to 8 ft @7s S, but the strong 36 mph S winds will keep it messy. On the day after, things improve with 3 ft @9s SSW swell and light 7 mph SE winds, creating clean conditions at spots like Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane. Best: day after.
