Today, the South is lighting up with 4 ft @ 8s SSW swell and a light 9 mph SW wind. Great options at Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane, both best from 09:27 to 17:32. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 8s with a moderate 14 mph W wind, still workable at spots like Ballinskelligs Bay. By the day after, conditions worsen with 4 ft @ 8s SW swell but fresh 19 mph W wind making it poor across the board. Best: today.
