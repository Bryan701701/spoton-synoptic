Today, the South is quiet with 4 ft @6s SE swell, but fresh 18 mph NNE winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions drop further to 2 ft @5s E with lighter 8 mph NNE winds, still not producing much. By the day after, we see a slight bump to 3 ft @5s E, but the fresh 18 mph NE winds will keep it choppy. Best: day after.
