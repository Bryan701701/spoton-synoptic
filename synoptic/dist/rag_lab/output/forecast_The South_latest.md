Today, the South is quiet with no surf action; the swell isn’t getting in and fresh 37 mph onshore winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 4 ft @9s SSW swell and lighter 18 mph SW winds, making it workable at spots like Ballinskelligs Bay. The day after, we drop back to 5 ft @7s with fresh 28 mph SSW winds, leading to poor conditions again. Best: tomorrow.
