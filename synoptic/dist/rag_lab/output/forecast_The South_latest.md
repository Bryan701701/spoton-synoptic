Today, the South is quiet with a fresh 20 mph S wind and 4 ft @ 8s S swell, so it’s not producing any surf. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 7 ft @ 9s SW swell and a lighter 16 mph W wind, making it workable at spots like Ballinskelligs Bay. Day after, the swell drops to 5 ft @ 8s S but is blown out by a strong 39 mph S wind, leaving it poor across the board. Best: tomorrow.
