Today, the South is quiet with no surf action—wrong swell angle and fresh 34 mph onshore winds. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 3 ft @9s S swell and light 9 mph WSW winds, making it a great day for fun waves at spots like Derrynane and Barley Cove. The day after also looks good with 2 ft @7s S swell and light 9 mph NNW winds, particularly at Derrynane and Strand. Best: tomorrow.
