Today, the South is quiet with 2 ft @5s ESE lines, fresh 21 mph E wind making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 2 ft @6s SE and light 7 mph NE winds, still not producing much. On New Year's Day, there's a slight improvement with 1 ft @6s SSE at Strand, offering a fun option with light 6 mph WNW winds. Best: day after.
