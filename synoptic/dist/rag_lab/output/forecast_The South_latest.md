Today, the South is clean and fun with 1ft @8s SW swell and light 5 mph WSW winds. Derrynane and Barley Cove are your best bets, offering playful conditions from mid-morning to late afternoon. Tomorrow, expect a significant jump to 7ft @7s SSW with fresh 25 mph SSW winds, making it blown out and poor across the board. By the day after, conditions improve to 4ft @8s SSW with 14 mph SW winds, offering workable surf at various spots. Best: today.
