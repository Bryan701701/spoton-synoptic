Today, the South is looking good with 4 ft @8s SSW swell and 14 mph S winds. Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane are your top picks, offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 5 ft @9s SSW with a moderate 16 mph SW wind, still keeping it fun at the same spots. By the day after, expect a hefty 10 ft @9s S swell, but with strong 40 mph S winds, it’ll be blown out. Best: tomorrow.
