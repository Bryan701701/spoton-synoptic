Today, the South is quiet with a strong 6 ft @10s SSW swell, but fresh 27 mph WSW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with an 8 ft @8s SSW swell and even stronger 37 mph SSW winds, keeping it messy. On the day after, the swell drops back to 6 ft @10s SSW with 22 mph SSW winds, still not ideal for surfing. Best: day after.
