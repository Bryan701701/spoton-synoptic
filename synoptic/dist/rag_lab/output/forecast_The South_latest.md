Today, Strand is the standout with 2 ft @7s S and fresh 17 mph WNW winds. It's a bit choppy, but still workable, especially on the push. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 1 ft @5s SSW, making it a quiet day across the coast. By the day after, we see similar 1 ft @7s SW, with light winds, but not much to get excited about. Best: today.
