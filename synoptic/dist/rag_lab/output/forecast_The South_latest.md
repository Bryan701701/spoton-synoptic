Today, the South is quiet with a 4 ft @6s E swell, but fresh 25 mph ENE winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 3 ft @6s ESE, with winds still fresh at 24 mph ENE, keeping conditions poor. The day after continues the trend with 3 ft @5s E swell and stronger winds at 30 mph ENE, making it a tough call for surfers. Best: today.
