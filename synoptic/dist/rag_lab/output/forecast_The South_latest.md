Today, the South is quiet with a 4 ft @6s SSW swell, but fresh 25 mph S winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with a stronger 9 ft @11s SW swell and continued 25 mph W winds, keeping it messy. Day after, we see a drop to 3 ft @8s SSW with lighter 15 mph S winds, offering some workable waves. Best: day after.
