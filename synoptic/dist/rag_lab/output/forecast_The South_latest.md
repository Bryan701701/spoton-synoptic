Today, the South is quiet with no surf action—wrong swell angle and fresh 33 mph SSW winds are blowing it out. Tomorrow, conditions improve significantly with 5 ft @ 8s SSW swell and light 3 mph NNE winds, making for clean surf at spots like Ballinskelligs Bay. The day after, expect smaller 2 ft @ 8s SSW waves with 13 mph WNW winds; workable at sheltered corners like Derrynane. Best: tomorrow.
