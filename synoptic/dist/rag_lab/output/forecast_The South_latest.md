Today, the South is lighting up with 5 ft @ 8s SSW swell and light 5 mph WNW winds. Spots like Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane are prime, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 9s SW, still clean with light 2 mph NW winds, making it fun at various beaches. By the day after, conditions worsen with 5 ft @ 7s SSW swell but fresh 28 mph SSW winds, leading to blown-out surf. Best: today.
