Today, the South is quiet with 4 ft @8s SW swell, but fresh 24 mph WSW wind is making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 8 ft @7s S, but with strong 36 mph S winds, it will be messy and challenging. By the day after, conditions improve to 3 ft @9s SSW with light 7 mph SE winds, offering a fun surf day. Best: day after.
