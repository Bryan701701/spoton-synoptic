Today, the South is quiet with 4 ft @6s SE swell but fresh 18 mph NNE wind making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a drop to 2 ft @5s E, still not producing much with light 8 mph NNE wind. The day after brings slightly better conditions at 3 ft @5s E, but the fresh 18 mph NE wind will keep it choppy. Best: day after.
