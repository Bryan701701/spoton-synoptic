Today, the South is lighting up with clean 2 ft @8s SSW swell and light NNW winds at 9 mph. Derrynane and Barley Cove are your top picks, both offering fun conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow sees a drop to 1 ft @9s with fresh NW winds at 13 mph, making it less inviting. The day after, conditions fade further with 1 ft @5s, so it’s best to enjoy today’s surf while it lasts! Best: today.
