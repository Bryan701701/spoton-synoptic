Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it’s looking good with 4 ft @10s WNW swell and light NE winds at 10 mph. Ballybunion Right and Ballybunion Beach are prime spots, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 6 ft @12s WNW swell but fresh ENE winds at 23 mph will make it blown out. By the day after, we see a return to 3 ft @10s WNW with lighter winds, making for a fun session at the same good spots. Best: today.
