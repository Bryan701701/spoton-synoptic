Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it's looking good with 4 ft @ 10s WNW swell and light NE winds at 10 mph. Ballybunion Right and Ballybunion Beach are prime spots, especially during the morning and early afternoon tides. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 6 ft @ 12s WNW swell but fresh ENE winds at 23 mph will make it poor across the board. By the day after, the swell eases to 3 ft @ 10s WNW with winds calming to 11 mph ENE, making it more workable at spots like Ballybunion. Best: today.
