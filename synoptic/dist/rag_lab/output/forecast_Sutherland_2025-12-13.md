Today in Sutherland, it’s a quiet scene with no surf action—wrong swell angle and fresh SW winds at 35 mph. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 8 ft @10s, but the fresh SW wind continues to keep things messy. By the day after, the swell eases to 7 ft @11s with slightly lighter SSW winds, still not ideal. Best: day after.
