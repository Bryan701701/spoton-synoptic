Today in Sutherland, it's looking poor with 10 ft @12s W swell and fresh 35 mph SW winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 8 ft @10s, but the fresh 31 mph SW wind continues to keep conditions messy. On the day after, the swell further decreases to 7 ft @11s with 26 mph SSW winds, still not ideal. Best: day after.
