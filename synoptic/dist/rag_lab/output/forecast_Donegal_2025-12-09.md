Today in Donegal, conditions are poor with a swell of 5 ft @ 12s WSW and fresh 26 mph ESE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a significant increase in swell to 11 ft @ 10s W, but the fresh 28 mph SW winds will keep it messy. On the day after, the swell drops slightly to 8 ft @ 11s WSW with strong 40 mph S winds, still resulting in challenging conditions. Best: tomorrow.
