Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking poor with 7 ft @8s NNW swell, but fresh 32 mph NNW winds are blowing it out. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 6 ft @7s NNW swell and winds picking up to 33 mph, keeping it messy. By the day after, the swell drops to 4 ft @6s NNW with 22 mph NNW winds, still not producing anything worthwhile. Best: none.
