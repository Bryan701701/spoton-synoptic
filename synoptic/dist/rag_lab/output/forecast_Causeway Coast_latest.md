Today at Causeway Coast, Portballintrae is offering some small but workable surf at 1 ft @ 10s WNW with a fresh 14 mph SSE wind. It's best to hit it during the tide window from 08:37 to 15:57. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2 ft @ 7s WSW with a stronger 25 mph SSW wind, leading to poor quality across the coast. The day after, similar 2 ft @ 6s ESE conditions persist with 24 mph SSE winds, keeping things blown out. Best: today.
