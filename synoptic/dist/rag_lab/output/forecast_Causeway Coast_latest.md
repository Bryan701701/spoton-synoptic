Today on the Causeway Coast, Portballintrae is the spot to be with a clean 2 ft @11s NW swell and light 8 mph NNE winds. It’s a great day for a surf session, especially from 08:53 to 16:03. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 2 ft @7s NNE with fresh 14 mph E winds, making it less inviting. Day after, Portballintrae holds 1 ft @8s NW, with stronger 17 mph W winds, so it’ll be a quiet one. Best: today.
