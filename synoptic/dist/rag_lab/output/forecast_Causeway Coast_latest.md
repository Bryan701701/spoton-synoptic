Today on the Causeway Coast, it's a bit rough with 3 ft @14s WNW swell but fresh 20 mph SSE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow drops to 1 ft @9s W with 18 mph S winds, so it’s looking pretty flat. The day after sees a slight improvement with 1 ft @8s W at Portballintrae, but still not much to write home about. Best: day after.
