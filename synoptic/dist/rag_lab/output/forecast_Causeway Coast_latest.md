Today on the Causeway Coast, conditions are poor with 3 ft @14s WNW swell, but fresh 20 mph SSE winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 1 ft @9s W, with similar fresh winds, keeping it unworkable. On the day after, there's a slight improvement with 1 ft @8s W at Portballintrae, but still not much to get excited about. Best: day after.
