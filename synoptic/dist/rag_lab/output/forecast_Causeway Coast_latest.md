Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking good with 4 ft @ 7s NNW swell and fresh 17 mph NNW winds. White Park Bay and Portballintrae are both clean and fun, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with the same swell but a quicker 6s period and stronger 28 mph N winds, making it poor across the board. The day after continues the trend with similar poor conditions, so best to enjoy today while you can! Best: today.
