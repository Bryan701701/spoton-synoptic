Today on the Causeway Coast, White Park Bay and Portballintrae are both working with 6 ft @ 13s WNW swell and a moderate 13 mph SE wind. It's a great day to hit the water, especially between 08:50 and 15:57. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @ 11s WNW with fresh 21 mph E winds, making it less favorable. By the day after, the swell further decreases to 2 ft @ 10s WNW with 13 mph ESE winds, still offering some fun at sheltered spots. Best: today.
