Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking good with 6 ft @ 13s WNW swell and a light 13 mph SE wind. White Park Bay and Portballintrae are your best bets, especially during the mid-day push. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @ 11s with fresh 21 mph E wind, making it a bit poor across the board. Day after, the swell further decreases to 2 ft @ 10s with similar wind, still not ideal. Best: today.
