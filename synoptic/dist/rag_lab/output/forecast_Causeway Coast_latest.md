Today, the Causeway Coast is seeing poor conditions with a weak 2 ft @7s NNE swell and fresh 15 mph ESE winds. Tomorrow, the swell drops further to 1 ft @8s WNW, still with fresh 18 mph WSW winds, making it less than ideal. The day after brings a significant increase to 7 ft @8s NNW, but with strong 19 mph NNW winds, leading to blown-out conditions. Best: today.
