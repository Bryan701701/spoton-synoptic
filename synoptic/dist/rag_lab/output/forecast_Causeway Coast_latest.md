Today on the Causeway Coast, it's a bit of a struggle with 3 ft @14s WNW swell but fresh 20 mph SSE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow drops to 1 ft @9s W with 18 mph S winds, so it’s looking quiet. The day after, Portballintrae shows some potential with 1 ft @8s W and lighter winds, but overall conditions remain poor. Best: day after.
