Today, the Causeway Coast is seeing poor conditions with 2 ft @5s ESE swell and fresh 36 mph ESE winds; it's blown out. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 4 ft @8s W, but the 34 mph SW winds will keep it messy. On the day after, conditions remain poor with 3 ft @8s W and 28 mph SSE winds. Best: day after.
