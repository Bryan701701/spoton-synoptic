Today, the Causeway Coast is seeing some fun surf with 3 ft @9s WNW at White Park Bay and Portballintrae, both with a fresh 13 mph WNW wind. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 4 ft @10s, still holding shape at the same spots, making for a solid day. On the day after, conditions remain decent with 4 ft @11s, but the wind shifts to a fresh SE, which may make it a bit choppy. Best: tomorrow.
