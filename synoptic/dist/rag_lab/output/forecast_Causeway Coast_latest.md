Today is looking poor across the Causeway Coast with 3 ft @11s WNW swell, but fresh 22 mph SSW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions worsen slightly with the same swell size but a drop in period to 9s and stronger 26 mph S winds, keeping it messy. By the day after, we see a slight improvement with 3 ft @9s WNW swell and lighter 17 mph SSE winds, making it workable at spots like White Park Bay and Portballintrae during the mid-tide window. Best: day after.
