Today, the Causeway Coast is seeing poor conditions with 3 ft @14s WNW swell, but fresh 20 mph SSE winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 1 ft @9s W, with similar fresh winds, keeping it flat and not producing. On the day after, there's a slight uptick with 1 ft @8s W swell, but still not much to write home about, with only Portballintrae showing some potential during the tide window. Best: day after.
