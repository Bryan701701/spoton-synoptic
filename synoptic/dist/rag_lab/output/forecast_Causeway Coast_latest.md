Today on the Causeway Coast, conditions are poor with 5 ft @14s WNW swell, but fresh 21 mph SSE winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 7 ft @14s WNW swell and 18 mph S winds, but still not ideal. The day after, the swell drops back to 5 ft @10s WNW with lighter 13 mph S winds, offering a bit more potential at sheltered spots like White Park Bay. Best: day after.
