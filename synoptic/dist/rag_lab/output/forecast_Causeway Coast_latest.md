Today, the Causeway Coast is experiencing poor conditions with 5 ft @14s WNW swell, but fresh 21 mph SSE winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 7 ft @14s WNW swell, though still affected by 18 mph S winds, making it workable at sheltered spots like White Park Bay and Portballintrae. The day after sees a drop to 5 ft @10s WNW, with lighter 13 mph S winds, offering a better chance for some fun waves. Best: tomorrow.
