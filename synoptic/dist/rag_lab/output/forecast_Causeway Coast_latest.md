Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking good with 4 ft @10s WNW swell and light 7 mph S winds. White Park Bay and Portballintrae are your best bets, especially on the push from 08:46 to 15:55. Tomorrow, the swell picks up slightly to 5 ft @12s but with fresh 13 mph S winds, making it a bit choppy. Day after, expect poor conditions with 4 ft @8s WSW and strong 40 mph S winds, likely blown out. Best: today.
