Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking fun with 2 ft @8s NNW swell and light 7 mph ENE winds. White Park Bay and Portballintrae are both clean and working well, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions ease with 2 ft @10s NW swell and light 1 mph SSE winds, but only Portballintrae will be the standout. Day after, expect poor conditions with 2 ft @7s NNE swell and fresh 10 mph ESE winds across the coast. Best: today.
