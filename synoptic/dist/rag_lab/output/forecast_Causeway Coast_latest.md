Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking pretty flat with 1 ft @5s WSW and fresh 13 mph SW winds. Tomorrow brings a slight bump to 2 ft @6s ESE, but still not much to write home about, with 17 mph SE winds adding some chop. The day after, we see a more substantial swell at 6 ft @10s W, but the fresh 22 mph SSW winds will make it blown out. Best: day after.
