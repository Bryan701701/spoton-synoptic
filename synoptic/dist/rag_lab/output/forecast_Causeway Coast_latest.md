Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking solid with 6 ft @ 8s NNW swell and fresh 18 mph NNW winds. Great options at White Park Bay and Portballintrae, both best from 08:52 to 16:06. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 7 ft @ 8s NNW swell and strong 29 mph NNW winds, making it poor for surfing. The day after stays similar with 7 ft @ 8s NNW and 25 mph N winds, still not ideal. Best: today.
