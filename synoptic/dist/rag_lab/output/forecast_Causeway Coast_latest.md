Today on the Causeway Coast, conditions are poor with 5 ft @7s NNW swell, but fresh 26 mph NNW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a drop to 3 ft @6s NW with similar fresh winds, keeping it messy. The day after brings 4 ft @7s NNW, but with the wind still fresh, it remains challenging. Best: day after.
