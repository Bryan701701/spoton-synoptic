Today, the Causeway Coast is looking OK with 4 ft @10s W swell and fresh 17 mph SSW winds. White Park Bay and Portballintrae are your best bets, especially around the tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 4 ft @11s WNW swell and lighter 7 mph S winds, making for cleaner surf. The day after, expect 5 ft @12s WNW swell with similar light winds, keeping it fun at the same spots. Best: tomorrow.
