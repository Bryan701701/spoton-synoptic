Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking fun with 3 ft @11s NW swell and light 5 mph E winds. White Park Bay and Portballintrae are your best bets, especially during the tide push. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @9s NW with a moderate 9 mph ESE breeze, still workable at Portballintrae. Day after, conditions worsen with 2 ft @6s NE and fresh 15 mph E winds, making it less inviting. Best: today.
