Today on the Causeway Coast, conditions are poor with 3 ft @ 6s S swell and fresh 23 mph S wind, making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell picks up slightly to 4 ft @ 8s W, but the wind increases to 27 mph SSW, keeping it messy. Day after looks promising as the swell jumps to 7 ft @ 11s NW with light 5 mph SE winds, offering clean conditions at spots like White Park Bay. Best: day after.
