Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking good with 2 ft @9s NNW swell and a light 13 mph E wind. White Park Bay and Portballintrae are your best bets, especially from 08:52 to 16:00. Tomorrow, conditions drop with a poor 2 ft @6s NE swell and fresh 19 mph E winds, making it a day to skip. By the day after, things improve again with 2 ft @8s NNW and light 7 mph ENE winds, offering fun waves at the same spots. Best: today.
