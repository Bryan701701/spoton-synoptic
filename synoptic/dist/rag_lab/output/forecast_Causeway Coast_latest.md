Today on the Causeway Coast, conditions are poor with a swell of 5 ft @ 8s from the W and fresh 11 mph SSE winds creating some chop. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with the same swell height but a longer period of 11s from the NW, though winds pick up to 17 mph, making it a bit breezy. The day after returns to poor conditions with 5 ft @ 9s NW swell and stronger 21 mph SW winds, likely making it messy. Best: tomorrow.
