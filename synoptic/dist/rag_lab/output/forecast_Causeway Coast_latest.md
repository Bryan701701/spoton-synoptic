Today on the Causeway Coast, Portballintrae is clean and fun at 2 ft @10s WNW with light 7 mph ESE winds. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 4 ft @12s, offering great conditions at both White Park Bay and Portballintrae, with light winds. The day after, expect 3 ft @10s, still solid at the same spots. Best: tomorrow.
