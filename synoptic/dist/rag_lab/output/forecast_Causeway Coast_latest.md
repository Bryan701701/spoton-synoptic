Today on the Causeway Coast, White Park Bay and Portballintrae are lighting up with fun 4 ft @10s WNW swell, groomed by light 7 mph S winds. Best conditions are on the push from 08:46 to 15:55. Tomorrow, swell builds to 5 ft @12s but with fresh 13 mph S winds, making it a bit choppy. Day after, expect poor conditions with 4 ft @8s WSW swell and strong 40 mph S winds, likely blown out. Best: today.
