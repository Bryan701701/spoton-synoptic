Today on the Causeway Coast, it's a bit rough with 6 ft @13s WNW swell and fresh 23 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 4 ft @10s W, but the fresh S winds continue, keeping it messy. Day after brings 5 ft @11s WNW with easing winds at 16 mph SW, offering some workable conditions at sheltered spots like White Park Bay and Portballintrae. Best: day after.
