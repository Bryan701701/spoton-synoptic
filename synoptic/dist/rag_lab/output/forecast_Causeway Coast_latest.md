Today on the Causeway Coast, it's a bit rough with 6 ft @13s WNW swell and fresh 23 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 4 ft @10s W, but the wind remains at 20 mph from the S, keeping conditions poor. By the day after, we get a bit of improvement with 5 ft @11s WNW and lighter 16 mph SW winds, making White Park Bay and Portballintrae the best bets during the tide window. Best: day after.
