Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking good with 4 ft @ 7s NNW swell and 17 mph NNW winds. White Park Bay and Portballintrae are your best bets, especially from 08:51 to 16:10. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @ 6s NNW with fresh 28 mph N winds, making it poor across the board. The day after stays similar with 4 ft @ 6s NW and 21 mph WSW winds, still not ideal. Best: today.
