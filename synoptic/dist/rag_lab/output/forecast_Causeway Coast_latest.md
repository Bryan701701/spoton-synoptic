Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking fun with 3 ft @ 8s NW swell and light 11 mph NW winds. Spots like White Park Bay and Portballintrae are firing, especially on the mid to late tide. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 1 ft @ 7s W with light 9 mph S winds, making it a bit quiet, but Portballintrae might still have a little something. Day after, expect 3 ft @ 12s WNW swell, but fresh 20 mph S winds will likely blow it out across the board. Best: today.
