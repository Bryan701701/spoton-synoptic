Today on the Causeway Coast, conditions are poor with 5 ft @10s NW swell and fresh 19 mph W winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 5 ft @9s NW swell and moderate 16 mph S winds, but still not producing great surf. By the day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @9s WNW with similar wind conditions, keeping it on the lower end of the scale. Best: tomorrow.
