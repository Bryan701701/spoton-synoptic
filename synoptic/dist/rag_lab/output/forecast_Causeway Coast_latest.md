Today on the Causeway Coast, conditions are poor with 5 ft @10s NW swell and fresh 19 mph W wind. Tomorrow, the swell remains at 5 ft @9s NW, but the wind shifts to a moderate 16 mph S, offering some workable corners at White Park Bay and Portballintrae. The day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @9s WNW with similar wind, still decent at the same spots. Best: tomorrow.
