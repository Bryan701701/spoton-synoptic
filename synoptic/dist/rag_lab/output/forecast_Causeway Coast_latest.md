Today, the Causeway Coast is seeing poor conditions with 8 ft @8s NNW swell and fresh 24 mph NNW winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, things improve slightly with 3 ft @9s WNW swell and 16 mph WNW winds, but still not producing well—best at White Park Bay and Portballintrae. The day after brings 4 ft @10s WNW swell, with similar winds, offering a bit more potential but still on the lower end. Best: day after.
