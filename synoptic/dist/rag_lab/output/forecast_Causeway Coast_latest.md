Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking decent with 3 ft @9s WNW swell and 13 mph WNW winds. White Park Bay and Portballintrae are your best bets, especially during the tides from 08:49 to 16:16. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 4 ft @10s, still with 12 mph WNW winds, keeping it fun at the same spots. Day after, the swell holds at 4 ft but the wind shifts to 15 mph SE, so expect some chop. Best: tomorrow.
