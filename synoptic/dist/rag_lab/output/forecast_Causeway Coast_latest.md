Today on the Causeway Coast, White Park Bay and Portballintrae are both lighting up with 3 ft @ 11s NW swell and light 5 mph E winds, making for clean conditions. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 9s NW with a slight increase in wind to 9 mph ESE; Portballintrae remains the best bet. Day after, conditions decline with 2 ft @ 6s NE and fresh 15 mph E winds, making it less appealing. Best: today.
