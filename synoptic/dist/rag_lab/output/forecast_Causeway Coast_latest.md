Today, the Causeway Coast is looking solid with 4 ft @10s WNW swell and light 3 mph NW winds. White Park Bay and Portballintrae are your best bets, especially on the push from 08:48 to 16:18. Tomorrow, similar conditions persist with 4 ft @12s WNW swell and a gentle 7 mph SSE breeze, keeping it fun at the same spots. Day after, expect 4 ft @6s S swell with fresh 34 mph SSE winds, making it blown out and poor across the board. Best: tomorrow.
