Today, the Causeway Coast is seeing 4 ft @9s W swell, but fresh 27 mph S winds are making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 5 ft @15s WNW, yet the wind remains fresh at 19 mph S, keeping conditions poor. On the day after, we can expect 7 ft @14s WNW, with similar wind conditions; however, White Park Bay and Portballintrae may offer some workable waves. Best: day after.
