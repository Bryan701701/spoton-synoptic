Today on the Causeway Coast, Portballintrae is your go-to with clean 1ft @7s WNW lines and light 6 mph WSW winds. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 6ft @7s with fresh 19 mph NNW winds, making it blown out and not workable. The day after sees a further increase to 7ft @7s, still with 24 mph NNW winds, keeping it messy. Best: today.
