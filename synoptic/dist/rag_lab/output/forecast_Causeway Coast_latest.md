Today on the Causeway Coast, Portballintrae is offering clean 2ft @10s WNW with a light 7 mph ESE breeze. It's a great day for a session, especially on the push from 08:52 to 15:58. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 4ft @12s WNW, still with light winds, making for fun conditions at both White Park Bay and Portballintrae. Day after, the swell drops slightly to 3ft @10s NW, but remains clean and workable. Best: tomorrow.
