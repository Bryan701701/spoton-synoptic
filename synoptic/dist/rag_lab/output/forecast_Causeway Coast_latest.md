Today on the Causeway Coast, conditions are poor with 5 ft @ 8s W swell and fresh 11 mph SSE winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow, expect a slight improvement with 5 ft @ 11s NW swell and moderate 17 mph NW winds, making for some workable corners. The day after, conditions drop back to poor with 5 ft @ 9s NW swell and fresh 21 mph SW winds, likely leading to more chop. Best: tomorrow.
