Today on the Causeway Coast, Portballintrae is the spot to be with clean 1 ft @ 9s WNW and light 5 mph WNW winds. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 3 ft @ 14s WNW but fresh 19 mph S winds will make it blown out. Day after, Portballintrae sees a return to 1 ft @ 10s WNW with 11 mph SE winds, offering some workable corners. Best: today.
