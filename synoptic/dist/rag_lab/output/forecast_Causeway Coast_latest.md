Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking poor with 7 ft @8s NNW swell and fresh 32 mph NNW winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 6 ft @7s NNW and winds picking up slightly to 33 mph, keeping it messy. By the day after, the swell drops to 4 ft @6s NNW with 22 mph winds, still not producing anything worthwhile. Best: none.
