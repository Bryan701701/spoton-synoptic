Today on the Causeway Coast, conditions are poor with 2 ft @7s NNE swell and fresh 17 mph E winds making it blown out. Tomorrow looks better as the swell holds at 2 ft but increases to 8s with light 6 mph E winds, providing some clean options at spots like White Park Bay and Portballintrae. The day after, the swell remains at 2 ft but shifts to 10s NW, with similar light winds, making Portballintrae the standout spot. Best: tomorrow.
