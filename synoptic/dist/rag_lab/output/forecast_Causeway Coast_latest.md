Today, the Causeway Coast is seeing 3 ft @11s WNW swell, but fresh 22 mph SSW winds are blowing it out, making conditions poor. Tomorrow, similar 3 ft @9s W swell continues with stronger 26 mph S winds, keeping it messy. On the day after, conditions improve slightly with 3 ft @9s WNW swell and 17 mph SSE winds, offering some workable waves at White Park Bay and Portballintrae during the tide window. Best: day after.
