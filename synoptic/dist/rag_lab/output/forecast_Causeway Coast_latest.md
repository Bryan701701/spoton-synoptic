Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking good with 4 ft @10s WNW swell and light 7 mph S winds. White Park Bay and Portballintrae are your best bets, especially on the push from 08:46 to 15:55. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 5 ft @12s WNW, but with fresh 13 mph S winds, it may be a bit choppy. Day after, expect 4 ft @8s WSW with strong 40 mph S winds, making it blown out. Best: today.
