Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking good with 3 ft @6s NW swell and light 8 mph SSW winds. White Park Bay and Portballintrae are the top picks, especially during the tide window from 08:50 to 16:13. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 6 ft @7s NNW swell and fresh 27 mph NNW winds, making it blown out and not producing. Day after, the swell returns to 3 ft @8s WNW with light 7 mph WSW winds, offering a cleaner session at the same good spots. Best: today.
