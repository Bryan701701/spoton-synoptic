Today on the Causeway Coast, it’s looking poor with 3 ft @11s WNW swell, but fresh 22 mph SSW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow continues the trend with the same swell size, dropping to 9s, but winds pick up to 26 mph S, keeping conditions messy. Day after shows a slight improvement with 3 ft @9s WNW swell and 17 mph SSE winds; some sheltered spots like White Park Bay and Portballintrae may offer workable conditions. Best: day after.
