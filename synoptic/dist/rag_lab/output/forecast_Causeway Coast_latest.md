Today on the Causeway Coast, it’s a bit blown out with fresh 22 mph SSW winds and 3 ft @ 11s WNW swell. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with 3 ft @ 9s W swell and stronger 26 mph S winds, keeping it messy. Day after shows slight improvement with 3 ft @ 9s WNW swell and 17 mph SSE winds, but still not ideal. Best: day after.
