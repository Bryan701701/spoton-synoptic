Today on the Causeway Coast, it's a tough call with 7 ft @12s WNW swell and fresh 27 mph SW winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 5 ft @10s WNW swell and lighter 13 mph SSE winds, but still not ideal—best at White Park Bay and Portballintrae during the mid-day push. The day after brings 5 ft @15s WNW swell with 11 mph E winds, making for cleaner conditions at the same spots. Best: day after.
