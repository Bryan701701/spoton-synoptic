Today on the Causeway Coast, White Park Bay and Portballintrae are both offering fun 5 ft @12s WNW swell with a fresh 16 mph SSW wind. Best conditions are during the tide window from 08:47 to 15:55. Tomorrow, conditions drop with a poor 4 ft @8s WSW swell and strong 39 mph S winds, making it less than ideal. The day after, the swell picks up to 7 ft @15s WNW, but the wind remains fresh at 17 mph SSE, keeping it tricky. Best: today.
