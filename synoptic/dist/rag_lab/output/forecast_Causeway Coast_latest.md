Today at Causeway Coast, Portballintrae is offering clean, fun conditions with 1ft @7s WNW swell and light 6 mph WSW winds. It's a great time to hit the water, especially between 08:52 and 16:05. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 6ft @7s NNW swell and fresh 19 mph NNW winds, making it blown out and not producing. The day after looks similar with 7ft @7s NNW swell and 24 mph NNW winds, so best to skip it. Best: today.
