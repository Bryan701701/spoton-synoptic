Today, the Causeway Coast is lighting up with clean 4 ft @10s WNW swell at White Park Bay and Portballintrae, thanks to a moderate 11 mph SSE wind. Both spots are best during the mid-day push from 08:50 to 15:57. Tomorrow, conditions drop with fresh 35 mph ESE winds making it blown out and unworkable. Day after, the wind eases to a light 4 mph NE, bringing back some fun with 4 ft @12s WNW swell at White Park Bay and Portballintrae. Best: today.
