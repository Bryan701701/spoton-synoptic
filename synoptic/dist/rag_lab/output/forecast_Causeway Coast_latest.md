Today, the Causeway Coast is flat with 1 ft @5s WSW swell and fresh 13 mph SW winds, so it's a quiet day. Tomorrow sees a slight bump to 2 ft @6s ESE, but with 17 mph SE winds, it remains poor. On the day after, the swell picks up to 6 ft @10s W, yet fresh 22 mph SSW winds will make it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
