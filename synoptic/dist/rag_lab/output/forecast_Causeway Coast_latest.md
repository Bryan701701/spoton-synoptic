Today on the Causeway Coast, conditions are poor with 4 ft @11s NW swell and fresh 20 mph E winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, things improve slightly with 2 ft @10s WNW swell and moderate 11 mph E winds, but still not producing much; only Portballintrae shows some promise. Day after, we see a bump back to 4 ft @13s WNW, with White Park Bay and Portballintrae being the best bets, though winds remain fresh. Best: day after.
