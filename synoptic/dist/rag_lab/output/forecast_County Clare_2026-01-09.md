Today in County Clare, surf is looking solid with 5 ft @9s WNW swell and fresh 18 mph NW winds. Doolin Point and Lahinch Beach are your best bets, offering fun conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 5 ft @10s WNW swell but fresh 22 mph WNW winds will make it blown out. By the day after, the swell eases to 2 ft @6s SW with lighter 12 mph S winds, but still not producing much. Best: today.
