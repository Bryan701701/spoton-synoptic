Today in County Clare, we have fun conditions with 5 ft @9s WNW swell and fresh 18 mph NW winds. Doolin Point and Lahinch Beach are the top picks, offering solid waves throughout the day. Tomorrow sees a drop in quality with 5 ft @10s WNW swell but fresh 22 mph WNW winds making it blown out. On the day after, conditions remain poor with 2 ft @6s SW swell and light 12 mph S winds. Best: today.
