Today in County Clare, it's looking solid with 5 ft @9s WNW swell and fresh 18 mph NW winds. Doolin Point and Lahinch Beach are your best bets, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 5 ft @10s WNW with fresh 22 mph W winds, making it blown out and poor across the board. By the day after, the swell eases to 2 ft @6s SW, still poor but slightly more manageable with lighter 12 mph S winds. Best: today.
