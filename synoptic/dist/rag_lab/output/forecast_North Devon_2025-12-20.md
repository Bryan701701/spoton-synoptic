North Devon is looking solid today with 4 ft @10s WSW swell and light ESE winds at 12 mph. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are both clean and working, with Lynmouth best around 08:17–16:08. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 4 ft but increases to 13s, with winds easing to 9 mph, making it another great day at spots like Woolacombe and Putsborough. Day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @12s, still workable at Woolacombe and Putsborough, but conditions will be a bit breezy. Best: tomorrow.
