Today on the West Coast, conditions are poor with 5 ft @10s WNW swell, but fresh 19 mph SW winds are making it messy. Tomorrow sees an increase to 8 ft @13s W, yet the fresh 21 mph SW wind keeps it blown out. By the day after, the swell drops back to 5 ft @8s WSW with strong 41 mph S winds, making for challenging conditions. Best: tomorrow.
