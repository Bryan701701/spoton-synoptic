Today in Pembrokeshire, it's looking solid with 6 ft @11s WSW swell and a moderate 17 mph SSE wind. Good spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are clean and working well, especially on the mid-tide push. Tomorrow, conditions drop with the swell still at 6 ft but a short 9s period and fresh 21 mph SW winds making it blown out. Day after, expect 11 ft @11s SW with strong 37 mph S winds, likely making it too wild to surf. Best: today.
