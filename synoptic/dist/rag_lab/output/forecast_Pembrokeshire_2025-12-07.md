Today in Pembrokeshire, it's looking good with 6 ft @11s WSW swell and fresh 17 mph SSE winds. Spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are clean and fun, especially on the mid-tide push. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 6 ft @9s SW with fresh 21 mph winds, making it a poor day for surf. The day after, we see a bigger swell at 11 ft @11s SW, but strong 37 mph S winds will blow it out. Best: today.
