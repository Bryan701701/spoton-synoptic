Today in Sutherland, it’s a bit of a bummer with poor conditions—8 ft @9s N swell but fresh 32 mph NNW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 6 ft @9s N swell and lighter 16 mph N winds, offering some workable corners at spots like Sango Bay and Strathy. By the day after, Sango Bay lights up with 4 ft @8s N and 30 mph NW winds, making it the best pick of the bunch. Best: day after.
