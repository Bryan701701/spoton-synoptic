Today in Sutherland, it's a quiet one with no surf action—flat conditions at 0 ft. Tomorrow, things pick up a bit with 6 ft @9s N swell, but expect fresh 16 mph N winds, so look for sheltered spots like Strathy or Sango Bay. The day after, Sango Bay shines with 4 ft @8s N and a fresh NW wind, making for some fun waves. Best: tomorrow.
