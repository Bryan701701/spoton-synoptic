Today in Sutherland, it's a no-go with poor conditions: 8 ft @9s N and fresh 32 mph NNW wind, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees some improvement with 6 ft @9s N and lighter 16 mph N wind, offering workable options at spots like Sango Bay and Strathy during the mid-tide windows. Day after, Sango Bay shines with 4 ft @8s N and 30 mph NW wind, creating a fun session. Best: tomorrow.
