Today in County Clare, it's a quiet one with 2 ft @10s WNW swell and fresh 12 mph NE wind. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 5 ft @12s WNW swell, though the wind picks up to 16 mph ENE, making it a bit choppy. The day after, the swell drops back to 2 ft @11s WNW, still with fresh ENE wind, but some sheltered spots like Lahinch Beach and Cregg Beach could be fun. Best: tomorrow.
