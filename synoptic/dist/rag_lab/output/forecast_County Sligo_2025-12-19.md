Today in County Sligo, it’s looking solid with 8 ft @ 12s WNW swell and light 10 mph WSW winds. Strandhill and Easkey spots are firing, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 5 ft @ 10s WNW with fresh 22 mph SE winds, making it a blown-out day. Day after, we see a nice rebound with 7 ft @ 15s WNW and light 7 mph SSE winds, perfect for catching some clean waves. Best: today.
