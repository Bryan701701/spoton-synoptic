Today in Moray, it's a tough call with 6 ft @7s N swell but fresh 30 mph NNW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, similar conditions persist with 6 ft @8s N swell and 31 mph NW winds, keeping it messy. By the day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @6s N with 19 mph NNW winds, still not producing much. Best: none.
