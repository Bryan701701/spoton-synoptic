Today on the East Coast, it's a bit of a struggle with 3 ft @7s NNE swell and fresh 19 mph NW wind. No good spots are working, so it's best to give it a miss. Tomorrow sees similar conditions with the swell holding at 3 ft @7s but with a slight increase in wind to 21 mph WNW, keeping it messy. Day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @6s with lighter 12 mph NW winds, but still not much to write home about. Best: today.
