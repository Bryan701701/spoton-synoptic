Today on the East Coast, it's a bit of a struggle with 3 ft @7s NNE swell and fresh 19 mph NW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees similar conditions with the same swell height but winds picking up to 21 mph WNW, keeping it messy. By the day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @6s NNE with lighter 12 mph NW winds, but still not producing much. Best: today.
