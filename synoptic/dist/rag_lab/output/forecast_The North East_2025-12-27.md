Today, Saltburn Beach is offering some fun with 2 ft @ 5s E and a fresh 14 mph NNE wind. It's a good time to catch some waves, especially during the tide window from 08:26 to 15:43. Tomorrow sees a bump to 3 ft @ 7s NE across several spots, including Saltburn Beach and Redcar, with similar wind conditions. Day after, the swell holds at 3 ft @ 8s NNE, still providing workable conditions at Saltburn Beach and others. Best: tomorrow.
