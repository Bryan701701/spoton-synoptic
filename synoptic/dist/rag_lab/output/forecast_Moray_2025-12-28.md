Today in Moray, it's looking good with clean 2 ft @9s NNE swell and light 6 mph NW winds. Fraserburgh and Pennan are prime spots to catch some fun waves, especially between 08:52 and 15:28. Tomorrow, conditions ease a bit with 2 ft @7s NNE swell and moderate 13 mph W winds, still workable at the same locations. By the day after, swell picks up to 4 ft @10s NNE with 15 mph NNW winds, creating more exciting surf at Fraserburgh and others. Best: today.
