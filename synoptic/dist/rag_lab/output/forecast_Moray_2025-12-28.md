Today in Moray, it's looking good with clean 2 ft @9s NNE swell across multiple spots, including Fraserburgh and Pennan, both holding shape under light 6 mph NW winds. Tomorrow, expect similar conditions but a slight drop to 2 ft @7s with fresh 13 mph W winds, making it a bit choppy. Day after, swell picks up to 4 ft @10s NNE, but wind increases to 15 mph NNW, adding some texture. Best: today.
