Today in Moray, it's looking good with clean 2 ft @9s NNE swell across the region. Light NW winds at 6 mph keep it tidy, making spots like Fraserburgh and Pennan prime for a surf session. Tomorrow drops slightly to 2 ft @7s, with fresh W winds at 13 mph adding some texture. By the day after, expect a solid 4 ft @10s NNE swell, though winds pick up to 15 mph NNW, creating some chop. Best: today.
