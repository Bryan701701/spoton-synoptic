Today, the South coast is quiet with no surf action—wrong swell angle and fresh 29 mph WSW wind. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 4 ft @9s SSW swell and a lighter 13 mph SSE wind, making it workable at spots like Ballinskelligs Bay. The day after, the swell picks up to 7 ft @9s SSW but remains blown out by 26 mph SW winds. Best: tomorrow.
