Today, the South is lighting up with 3 ft @ 8s SSW swell and fresh 14 mph WSW winds. Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane are both clean and fun, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions ease with 2 ft @ 8s SW swell and light 4 mph NW winds, making for a mellow surf day at spots like Derrynane and Barley Cove. Day after, expect 3 ft @ 7s SSW with strong 35 mph SSW winds, resulting in blown-out conditions across the region. Best: today.
