Today in the Hebrides, surf is looking good with 4 ft @ 8s NNW swell and fresh 15 mph W winds. Tolsta and Port of Ness are both working well, especially around their tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 5 ft @ 8s NNW swell but fresh 26 mph N winds will make it blown out across the board. Day after brings a solid 5 ft @ 9s W swell with light 8 mph WSW winds, making for clean and fun surf at spots like Europie and Barvas. Best: day after.
