North Devon is looking good today with 4 ft @10s W swell and a moderate 13 mph NW wind. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are prime spots, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @6s SW with fresh 26 mph SSE winds, making it a poor day for surfing. The day after, swell picks up to 6 ft @9s WSW but remains blown out with 22 mph SW winds. Best: today.
