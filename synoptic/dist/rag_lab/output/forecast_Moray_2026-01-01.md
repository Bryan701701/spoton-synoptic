Today in Moray, it’s a bit rough with 6 ft @7s NNW swell and fresh 31 mph NW winds—definitely blown out. Tomorrow sees similar conditions with 6 ft @8s N swell and 27 mph ENE winds, keeping it messy. Day after, swell increases to 7 ft @7s N, but the 24 mph N winds continue to chop it up. Best: none.
