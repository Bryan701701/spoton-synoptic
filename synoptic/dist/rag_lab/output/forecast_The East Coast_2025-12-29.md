Today on the East Coast, it's a quiet scene with 1 ft @ 7s NNE swell and fresh 13 mph NW winds. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 3 ft @ 9s NE swell, especially at Aberdeen Harbour, where it should be clean and fun. The day after, the swell drops slightly to 2 ft @ 10s NNE, but the fresh W winds may keep it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
