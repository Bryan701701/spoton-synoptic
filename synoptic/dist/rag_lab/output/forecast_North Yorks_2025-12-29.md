Today in North Yorks, it's looking good with 3 ft @9s NNE swell and a fresh 15 mph N wind. Withernsea and Filey are both solid choices, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @8s NNE with a stronger 20 mph NNE wind, making it poor across the board. By the day after, we see a nice improvement with 5 ft @9s N swell and light 7 mph W winds, creating clean conditions at spots like Withernsea and Filey. Best: day after.
