North Yorks is looking fun today with 3ft @9s NNE swell and fresh 15 mph N winds. Withernsea and Filey are solid picks, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4ft @8s NNE with fresh 20 mph NNE winds making it blown out across the board. Day after, the swell picks up to 5ft @9s N with light 7 mph W winds, offering clean and enjoyable surf. Best: day after.
