Today on the East Coast, conditions are poor with 6 ft @6s SE swell and fresh 41 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 6 ft @8s SSE swell and moderate 16 mph S winds, but still not producing much. By the day after, we drop to 3 ft @6s SSE with light 5 mph W winds, offering some clean options at spots like Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay. Best: day after.
