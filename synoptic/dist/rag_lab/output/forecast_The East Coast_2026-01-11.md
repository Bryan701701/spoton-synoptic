Today on the East Coast, it’s a no-go with 6 ft @6s SE swell and fresh 41 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 6 ft @8s SSE swell and lighter 16 mph S winds, but still not producing well; only Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay show some potential. Day after brings 3 ft @6s SSE with light 5 mph W winds, making it the best day for a surf session at spots like Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay. Best: day after.
