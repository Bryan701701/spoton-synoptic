Today in Cornwall, North coast is lighting up with clean 5ft @11s W swell and light SSE winds. Crantock and Fistral are prime spots, especially early on the push. Tomorrow, expect a solid increase to 7ft @14s W, with light ESE winds keeping conditions tidy. Day after, the swell drops back to 5ft @13s W, but remains fun with moderate N winds. Best: tomorrow.
