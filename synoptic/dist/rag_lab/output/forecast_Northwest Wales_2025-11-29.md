Today in Northwest Wales, surf is looking fun with 3 ft @9s WSW at spots like Porth Oer and Hells Mouth, both offering clean conditions with light S winds at 3 mph. Tomorrow, things drop to 2 ft @7s WNW, still workable at Porth Oer but overall less exciting. By the day after, conditions worsen with 4 ft @7s WSW but fresh 29 mph S winds will make it blown out everywhere. Best: today.
