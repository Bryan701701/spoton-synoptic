Today, the Causeway Coast is seeing poor conditions with 4 ft @9s W swell and fresh 27 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell increases to 5 ft @15s WNW, but the onshore wind at 19 mph keeps it messy. By the day after, the swell peaks at 7 ft @14s WNW, with some sheltered spots like White Park Bay and Portballintrae offering workable waves despite the fresh wind. Best: day after.
