Today on the Causeway Coast, conditions are poor with 4 ft @9s W swell and fresh 27 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 5 ft @15s WNW swell, but still fresh 19 mph S winds keep it messy. By the day after, the swell picks up to 7 ft @14s WNW, with winds easing to 17 mph S, offering some workable conditions at spots like White Park Bay and Portballintrae. Best: day after.
