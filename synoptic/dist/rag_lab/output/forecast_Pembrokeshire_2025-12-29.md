Today in Pembrokeshire, we have clean, small surf at 1 ft @ 9s SW with a moderate 11 mph NE wind. St Brides Bay and Tenby are your best bets, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 1 ft @ 9s SSW, still fun for beginners. Day after, the swell picks up slightly to 1 ft @ 11s WSW, but with light 2 mph N winds, it should be nice and glassy. Best: today.
