Today in Pembrokeshire, St Brides Bay and Tenby are both offering clean 1ft @9s SW surf with a moderate 11 mph NE wind. Perfect for a fun session at the sheltered corners! Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 1ft @9s SSW swell and the same wind, keeping it mellow. Day after, the swell picks up slightly to 1ft @11s WSW with light 2 mph N winds, making for a nice, glassy ride. Best: day after.
