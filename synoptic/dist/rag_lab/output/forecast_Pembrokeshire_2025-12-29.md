Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a clean 1 ft @ 9s SW with light NE winds at 11 mph. St Brides Bay and Tenby are both working nicely, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, expect similar conditions with 1 ft @ 9s SSW and ENE winds, keeping it fun for a mellow session. On the day after, the swell picks up slightly to 1 ft @ 11s WSW, with light N winds, making for a pleasant surf day. Best: today.
