Today on the West Coast, conditions are poor with 6 ft @9s WSW swell and a fresh 40 mph SSW wind, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees an increase in swell to 11 ft @16s, but the same fresh SSW wind will keep it messy. Day after, the swell drops to 8 ft @12s with 35 mph SW winds, still not ideal. Best: none.
