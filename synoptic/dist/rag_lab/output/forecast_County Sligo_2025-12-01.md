Today in County Sligo, it's looking good with 4 ft @10s NW swell and light 12 mph SSW winds. Dunmoran Strand and Easkey Left are the top picks, both offering fun conditions from mid-morning to late afternoon. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 7 ft @13s WNW swell and fresh 24 mph SSW winds, making it blown out and poor across the board. Day after, the swell remains at 7 ft @11s WNW with 17 mph SW winds; Easkey Left and Strandhill may offer some workable waves during the tide windows. Best: today.
