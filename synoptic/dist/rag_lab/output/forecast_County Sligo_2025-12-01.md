Today in County Sligo, Strandhill and Easkey Left are both clean and fun at 3 ft @10s NW with a light 9 mph S wind. Great conditions for a surf session, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 7 ft @13s WNW, still holding clean lines, making it a perfect day for more experienced surfers. Day after, fresh 22 mph W winds will blow out the surf, leaving it poor across the coast. Best: tomorrow.
