Today in Sutherland, it’s a solid 5 ft @10s N with fresh 15 mph N winds. Melvich and Strathy are your best bets, with sheltered corners working nicely. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @9s with moderate S winds, still offering fun conditions. By the day after, expect a bit more power at 4 ft @11s WNW, with S winds keeping it clean. Best: day after.
