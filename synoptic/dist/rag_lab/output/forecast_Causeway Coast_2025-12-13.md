Today on the Causeway Coast, it's looking poor with 6 ft @13s WNW swell, but fresh 23 mph S winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @10s, still messy with 20 mph S winds. Day after brings a slight improvement with 5 ft @11s WNW, but only White Park Bay and Portballintrae show potential. Best: day after.
