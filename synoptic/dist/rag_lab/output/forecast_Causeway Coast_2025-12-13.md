Today, the Causeway Coast is seeing poor conditions with 6 ft @ 13s WNW swell and fresh 23 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @ 10s W, but the fresh 20 mph S wind continues to keep it messy. On the day after, conditions improve slightly to 5 ft @ 11s WNW with 16 mph SW winds, making it workable at spots like White Park Bay and Portballintrae during the tide window. Best: day after.
