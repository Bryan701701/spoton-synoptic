Today in North Devon, it’s a tough one with 6 ft @10s SW swell and fresh 25 mph S winds making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 5 ft @10s WSW swell and moderate 17 mph SW winds, offering some workable conditions at spots like Woolacombe and Croyde Beach during the mid-tide push. The day after, conditions remain similar with 4 ft @10s WSW swell and lighter 14 mph SSE winds, still providing fun waves at various beaches. Best: tomorrow.
