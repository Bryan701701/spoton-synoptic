Today in South Devon, it’s looking good with clean 3 ft @ 8s SW swell and light 3 mph N winds. Bovisand Reef, Challborough, and Bantham are all firing, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop significantly with fresh 40 mph WNW winds making it blown out and poor across the board. Day after, Bantham shows some promise with 4 ft @ 7s SW and lighter 7 mph ESE winds, but Bovisand and Challborough will struggle. Best: today.
