Today in South Devon, it's looking good with 3 ft @8s SW swell and light 3 mph N winds. Bovisand Reef, Challborough, and Bantham are all working well, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions will drop significantly with fresh 40 mph WNW winds making it poor across the board. Day after, Bantham shows some promise with 4 ft @7s SW and lighter 7 mph ESE winds, but Bovisand and Challborough won't be as favorable. Best: today.
