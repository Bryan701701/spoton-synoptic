Today in Donegal, it's looking good with 4 ft @ 11s W swell and a moderate 14 mph ESE wind. Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand are both clean and fun, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 6 ft @ 11s WSW swell and fresh 22 mph SSW winds, making it poor across the region. The day after, expect even bigger 8 ft @ 14s WSW swell but with strong 26 mph SE winds, keeping it blown out. Best: today.
