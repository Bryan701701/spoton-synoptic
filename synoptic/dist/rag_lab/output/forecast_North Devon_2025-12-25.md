Today in North Devon, it's a bit rough with 3 ft @5s ENE swell and fresh 36 mph ENE winds. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 2 ft @4s, still with fresh 30 mph ENE winds, keeping it messy. The day after remains similar with 2 ft @5s and easing winds at 9 mph E, but still not producing much. Best: day after.
