Today in the Hebrides, conditions are challenging with a hefty 10 ft @10s N swell and fresh 36 mph N winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 9 ft @9s N, but the fresh NNW wind at 24 mph will still keep it messy. Day after, the swell continues to decrease to 7 ft @9s N with 29 mph N winds, still not ideal. Best: none.
