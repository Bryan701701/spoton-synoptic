Today in the Hebrides, it's a challenging surf day with 10 ft @10s N swell and fresh 36 mph N winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 9 ft @9s N, but the fresh NNW wind at 24 mph continues to create messy conditions. By the day after, the swell drops further to 7 ft @9s N with 29 mph N winds, still not ideal. Best: none.
