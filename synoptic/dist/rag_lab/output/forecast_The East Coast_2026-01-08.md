Today, the East Coast is lighting up with clean 4 ft @ 8s E swell and light W winds. Great options include Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay, both offering fun peaks during the best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 6s E with fresh WNW winds, making it a quieter day, but Dunbar and St Andrews West will still have some rideable waves. By the day after, we see a solid rebound with 5 ft @ 8s E swell and light SSW winds, perfect for catching some action at spots like Coldinham Bay and Kingsbarns. Best: day after.
