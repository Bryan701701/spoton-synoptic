The East Coast is looking solid! Today, you can catch 4ft @8s E swell at spots like Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay with light W winds, best during the mid-morning and afternoon tides. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2ft @6s E with WNW winds, making it a bit less exciting, but Dunbar and St Andrews West will still have some fun peaks. By the day after, conditions improve again with 5ft @8s E swell and light SSW winds, perfect for a surf session at Kingsbarns or St Andrews East. Best: day after.
