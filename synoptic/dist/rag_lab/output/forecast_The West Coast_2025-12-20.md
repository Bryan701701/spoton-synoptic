Today on the West Coast, conditions are poor with a swell of 4 ft @ 11s WNW and fresh 21 mph SSE winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a bump to 7 ft @ 12s WSW, but with strong 30 mph ESE winds, it’ll be challenging. By the day after, the swell drops to 5 ft @ 12s W with lighter 15 mph ENE winds, offering some workable options at spots like Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay. Best: day after.
