Today, Dingle Peninsula is lighting up with 3 ft @10s WNW swell and fresh 13 mph E winds. Ballybunion Right and Ballybunion Beach are your best bets, especially during the early and mid-day windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @8s, still workable at the same spots, but expect a bit more chop with 12 mph NE winds. Day after, conditions remain similar with 2 ft @9s NW swell and 14 mph NE winds. Best: today.
