Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it's looking good with 3 ft @10s WNW swell and a moderate 13 mph E wind. Ballybunion Right and Ballybunion Beach are your best bets, especially during the morning and early afternoon tides. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @8s, still workable at the same spots but a bit weaker. The day after holds similar conditions with 2 ft @9s NW swell, but expect a fresh NE wind. Best: today.
