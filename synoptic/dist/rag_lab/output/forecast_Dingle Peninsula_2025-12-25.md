Dingle Peninsula is looking fun today with 3 ft @10s WNW swell and fresh 13 mph E winds. Best spots include Ballybunion Right and Ballybunion Beach, both offering clean conditions through the morning and into the afternoon. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @8s, still workable but a bit smaller, with NE winds at 12 mph. By the day after, expect similar 2 ft @9s conditions, but with a slight uptick in wind to 14 mph NE. Best: today.
