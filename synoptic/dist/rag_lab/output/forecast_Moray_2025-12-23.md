Today in Moray, it's a quiet one with 2 ft @7s E swell and fresh 19 mph SE winds, making for blown-out conditions. Tomorrow looks better with 2 ft @7s E and lighter 10 mph S winds at Fraserburgh, offering a fun window from 08:51 to 15:23. The day after, the swell drops to 1 ft @5s, so it’s best to give it a miss. Best: tomorrow.
