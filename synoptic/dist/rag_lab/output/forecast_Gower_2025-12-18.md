Today, Gower is lighting up with solid 6 ft @ 13s WSW swell and a light 11 mph S wind. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are the top picks, especially during the tides from 08:19 to 16:08. Tomorrow, conditions take a turn with 10 ft @ 10s WSW swell and fresh 22 mph WSW winds, making it blown out across the board. The day after, the swell drops to 5 ft @ 8s SW with 19 mph SSE winds, still not producing well. Best: today.
