Today in Gower, it's a great day for surfing with 6 ft @ 13s WSW swell and light 11 mph S winds. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are the top picks, both offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 10 ft @ 10s WSW swell and fresh 22 mph WSW winds, making it poor for surfing. The day after continues the trend with 5 ft @ 8s SW swell and 19 mph SSE winds, still not ideal. Best: today.
