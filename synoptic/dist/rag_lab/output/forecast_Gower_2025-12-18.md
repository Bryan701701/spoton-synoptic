Today, Gower is lighting up with solid 6 ft @ 13s WSW swell and a gentle 11 mph S wind. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are prime spots, especially during the morning and mid-day tides. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 10 ft @ 10s WSW swell and fresh 22 mph WSW winds, making it poor across the board. Day after, still poor with 5 ft @ 8s SW swell and 19 mph SSE winds. Best: today.
