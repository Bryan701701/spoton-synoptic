Today in County Clare, surf is on the smaller side at 5 ft @8s W with fresh 21 mph WSW wind making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 4 ft @9s WSW, but with 24 mph S winds, conditions remain poor. The day after brings a more substantial swell at 9 ft @15s W, with 19 mph SSE winds, but still not ideal. Best: day after.
