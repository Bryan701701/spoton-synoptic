Today in the Hebrides, it’s a bit rough with 7 ft @13s WSW swell and fresh 20 mph SE winds. All spots are blown out, so it’s best to give it a miss. Tomorrow sees a drop to 3 ft @10s with 23 mph ESE winds, still messy and not producing. Day after brings some improvement with 6 ft @12s WSW and lighter 13 mph ESE winds, making it workable at spots like Europie and Barvas during the mid-tide push. Best: day after.
