Today in the Hebrides, it's a bit of a struggle with 7 ft @13s WSW swell and fresh 20 mph SE winds making things blown out. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @10s with 23 mph ESE winds, keeping conditions poor. On the day after, we see a slight improvement with 6 ft @12s WSW swell and lighter 13 mph ESE winds, making it more workable at spots like Europie and Barvas. Best: day after.
