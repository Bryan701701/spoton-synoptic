Today in the Hebrides, it’s a bit rough with 7 ft @13s WSW swell and fresh 20 mph SE winds making for blown-out conditions. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @10s WSW with 23 mph ESE winds, keeping things messy. On the day after, we see a slight improvement with 6 ft @12s WSW swell and lighter 13 mph ESE winds, offering some workable options at spots like Europie and Barvas during the mid-tide. Best: day after.
