Today in the Hebrides, it’s a tough call with 7 ft @13s WSW swell and fresh 20 mph SE winds making for blown-out conditions. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @10s with 23 mph ESE winds, keeping it messy across the board. Day after, conditions improve slightly with 6 ft @12s WSW swell and lighter 13 mph ESE winds, offering some workable waves at spots like Europie and Barvas. Best: day after.
