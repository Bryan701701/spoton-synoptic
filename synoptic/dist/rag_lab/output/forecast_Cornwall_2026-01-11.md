Today in Cornwall, conditions are poor with 4 ft @7s WSW swell across the North, South, and West coasts, but fresh onshore winds at 23-32 mph are making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight increase to 6 ft @10s W with similar fresh winds, still not ideal. The day after, expect 5-8 ft @9-10s WSW swell with lighter winds, offering better conditions at spots like Crantock and Sennen Cove. Best: day after.
