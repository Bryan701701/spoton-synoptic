Today in Caithness, it’s looking good with 4ft @11s NNW swell and light 8 mph WSW winds. Spots like Point of Ness and Murkle Point are clean and working well, especially from 09:05 to 15:25. Tomorrow, conditions shift slightly with the same swell but winds picking up to 16 mph NNE, making it a bit choppy—still surfable at places like Thurso East. By the day after, the swell drops to 2ft @8s NE, but with lighter winds, it’ll be more manageable at spots like Sinclair's Bay. Best: today.
