Today on Gower, conditions are poor with 3 ft @ 5s ENE swell and fresh 19 mph NE winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 2 ft @ 5s ESE with lighter 8 mph ENE winds, but still not producing well. The day after, swell returns to 3 ft @ 5s E with moderate 13 mph ENE winds, keeping it messy. Best: tomorrow.
