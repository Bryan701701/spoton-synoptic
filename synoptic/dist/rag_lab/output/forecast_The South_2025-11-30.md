Today, the South is looking clean with 1 ft @ 8s SW at spots like Derrynane and Barley Cove, thanks to light 5 mph WSW winds. Best windows are during the mid to late tide, so catch it between 09:14 and 17:33. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 7 ft @ 7s SSW with fresh 25 mph SSW winds, making it blown out and poor across the board. The day after, surf improves to 4 ft @ 8s SSW with moderate 14 mph SW winds, offering more workable conditions. Best: today.
