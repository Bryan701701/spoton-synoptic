Today, the South is quiet with 6 ft @7s S swell but fresh 34 mph S wind has it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve as the swell drops to 3 ft @9s S with light 9 mph WSW wind, making it a fun day at spots like Ballinskelligs Bay. The day after, the swell continues to drop to 2 ft @7s S, still clean with 9 mph NNW wind, offering workable conditions at a few spots. Best: tomorrow.
