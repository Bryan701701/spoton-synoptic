Today in the North East, it's a quiet one with 1 ft @3s SSE across the board and fresh 10 mph S winds. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 1 ft @5s SSE at Saltburn Beach, but still not much to write home about with 16 mph SSW winds. Day after, the swell bumps up to 2 ft @4s SSW, but fresh 19 mph SSW winds will keep it choppy. Best: tomorrow.
