Today in the Hebrides, it's a tough call with 20 ft @14s WSW swell and fresh 52 mph SW winds making it blown out—definitely not producing. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 9 ft @11s NW swell and 21 mph NNW winds, but still messy across the board. By the day after, we see a further drop to 6 ft @10s N with light 13 mph E winds, offering some workable options at spots like Dalmore and Port of Ness during the mid-tide windows. Best: day after.
