Today in North Yorks, surf is flat with no swell hitting the coast—wind is fresh from the south at 22 mph. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 1 ft @ 8s N swell, but still not producing much; wind eases to 16 mph SW. Day after, conditions drop back to 2 ft @ 4s SSW with fresh onshore, making it poor again. Best: tomorrow.
