Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a bit quiet with 2 ft @6s NW swell and fresh 16 mph NNW wind. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with the same swell size and angle, but the period drops to 5s, keeping it on the poor side. Day after also shows 2 ft @5s NW, with slightly lighter winds at 12 mph, but still not much to write home about. Best: today.
