Today in County Sligo, it's a quiet day with 2 ft @11s N swell, but the wind is on it at 5 mph S, making it less than ideal. Tomorrow sees a bump to 5 ft @8s NNW, but fresh 20 mph NW winds will chop it up, resulting in blown-out conditions. The day after brings even bigger surf at 7 ft @9s N, with 22 mph N winds, keeping it messy. Best: today.
