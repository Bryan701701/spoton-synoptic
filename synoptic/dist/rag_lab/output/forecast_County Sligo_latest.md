Today in County Sligo, conditions are poor with 7 ft @9s N swell and fresh 19 mph N wind, making it blown out. Tomorrow, expect a nice improvement with 5 ft @9s N swell and light 3 mph NNW wind, offering clean options at spots like Dunmoran Strand and Easkey. The day after, conditions will be okay with 6 ft @8s N swell and moderate 17 mph NNE wind, still workable at sheltered corners. Best: tomorrow.
