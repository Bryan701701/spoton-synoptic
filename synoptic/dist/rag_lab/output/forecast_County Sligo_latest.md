Today in County Sligo, it's looking poor with 6 ft @9s WNW swell but fresh 20 mph SW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 5 ft @9s WSW swell and stronger 26 mph S winds, keeping it messy. Day after, the swell picks up slightly to 6 ft @14s WNW, but with 23 mph S winds still affecting the quality. Best: day after.
