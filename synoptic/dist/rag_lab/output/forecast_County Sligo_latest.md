Today in County Sligo, Strandhill and Easkey Left are both working with 3 ft @ 10s WNW and fresh 17 mph SE winds. Expect some fun surf, especially during the tide push from 08:40 to 16:12. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @ 9s with similar winds, but it’s looking poor across the board. The day after, the swell increases slightly to 4 ft @ 10s, but fresh 26 mph S winds will make it blown out. Best: today.
