Today in County Sligo, Strandhill is the standout with 3 ft @ 11s NW, offering clean conditions despite a fresh 13 mph E wind. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 9s NW, and conditions will be poor across the board, so it’s best to give it a miss. The day after continues the trend with 2 ft @ 6s NNE, remaining unproductive. Best: today.
