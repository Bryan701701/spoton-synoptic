Today in County Sligo, surf is 4 ft @10s from the WNW, but fresh 21 mph SE winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with 7 ft @15s WNW swell, still with 20 mph ESE winds, keeping it messy. By the day after, things clean up with 4 ft @12s WNW and light 4 mph E winds, making for some fun waves at spots like Strandhill and Easkey. Best: day after.
