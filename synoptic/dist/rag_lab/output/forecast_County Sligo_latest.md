Today in County Sligo, conditions are poor with 4 ft @10s WNW swell and fresh 18 mph S winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees an improvement with 5 ft @12s WNW swell and lighter 12 mph S winds, particularly at Strandhill and Easkey, offering some workable options. The day after, the swell builds to 6 ft @12s WNW, still with 12 mph S winds, keeping Strandhill and Easkey in the mix, though conditions remain mixed. Best: tomorrow.
