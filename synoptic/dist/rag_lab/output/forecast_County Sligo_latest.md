County Sligo is looking good today with 4 ft @8s NNW swell and light 11 mph S winds. Dunmoran Strand and Easkey Left are your best bets, both offering fun conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 6 ft @8s NNW with fresh 20 mph NNW winds, making it blown out and poor across the board. On the day after, we see a nice rebound with 5 ft @9s NW swell and lighter 9 mph WSW winds, perfect for some clean surf. Best: today.
