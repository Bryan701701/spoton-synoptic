Today, surf is on the small side at 2 ft @7s N, with fresh 7 mph NE winds creating some onshore chop. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 2 ft @9s NNW, still affected by light ENE winds. The day after sees a slight improvement to 2 ft @11s NNW, but the light ESE winds will keep it a bit choppy. Best: day after.
