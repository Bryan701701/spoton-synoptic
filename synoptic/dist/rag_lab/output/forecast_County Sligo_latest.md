Today in County Sligo, it's a solid day with 7 ft @10s NNW swell and fresh 11 mph NE winds. Dunmoran Strand and Easkey Right are your go-to spots, with Dunmoran holding the best tide from 09:29 to 17:16. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 5 ft @9s, but conditions remain clean with light 9 mph SW winds; still plenty of fun at spots like Easkey Left. On the day after, the surf eases to 3 ft @9s, but expect stronger 15 mph SSW winds; only a few spots like Strandhill and Easkey Left will be workable. Best: today.
