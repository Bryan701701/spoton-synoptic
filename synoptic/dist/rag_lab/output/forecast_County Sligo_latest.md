Today in County Sligo, we’ve got 4 ft @ 8s WNW with fresh 16 mph SSW winds. Strandhill and Easkey spots are working, so look for some fun waves, especially at Strandhill during the tide window. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 6 ft @ 11s NNW and lighter 11 mph WNW winds, making it a great day for a surf session at places like Dunmoran Strand and Easkey. Day after, it drops to 5 ft @ 10s NNW with fresh 19 mph S winds, leading to blown-out conditions. Best: tomorrow.
