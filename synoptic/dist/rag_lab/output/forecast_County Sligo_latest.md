Today in County Sligo, conditions are poor with 4 ft @9s WSW swell, but fresh 23 mph S winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 10 ft @17s WNW with lighter 13 mph S winds, offering some workable options at spots like Strandhill and Easkey. The day after, the swell holds at 10 ft @13s WNW, but fresh 25 mph WSW winds will keep it messy. Best: tomorrow.
