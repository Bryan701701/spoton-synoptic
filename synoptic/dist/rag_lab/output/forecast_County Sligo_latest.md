Today in County Sligo, it's looking good with 5 ft @8s NNW swell and light 10 mph NNW winds. Great options at Dunmoran Strand and Easkey Right, both offering fun conditions. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 7 ft @9s N but with fresh 17 mph NNE winds, making it a bit choppy. On the day after, conditions drop with 7 ft @9s N swell and strong 24 mph N winds, leading to blown-out surf. Best: today.
