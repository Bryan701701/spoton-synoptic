Today in County Sligo, we’ve got solid surf at 7 ft @ 14s WNW with a fresh 16 mph SSE wind. Strandhill and Easkey spots are looking good, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 11s WNW, still workable at Strandhill but overall a bit quieter. By the day after, conditions improve slightly with 3 ft @ 9s WNW and lighter winds, making for a fun session at Strandhill and Easkey Left. Best: today.
