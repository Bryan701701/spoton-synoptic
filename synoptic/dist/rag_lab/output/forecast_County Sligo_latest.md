Today in County Sligo, conditions are poor with 5 ft @9s WSW swell and fresh 26 mph S winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 7 ft @15s WNW swell, but the fresh 19 mph S winds will still keep it messy. On the day after, the swell builds to 8 ft @14s WNW, but the same fresh S winds will continue to affect the quality. Best: day after.
