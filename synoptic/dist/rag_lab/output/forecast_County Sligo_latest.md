Today in County Sligo, it's looking great with 4 ft @ 12s WNW swell and light 4 mph NE winds. Strandhill and Easkey spots are both clean and working well, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 11s, still offering some fun at Strandhill, but the others may not deliver. Day after, the swell picks back up to 4 ft @ 12s NW with light winds, making for a solid surf day. Best: today.
