Today in County Sligo, surf is looking good with 6 ft @12s WNW swell and fresh 17 mph SSW winds. Strandhill and Easkey spots are your best bets, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @10s with fresh 22 mph S winds, making it less appealing across the board. By the day after, we see a solid increase to 10 ft @16s WNW, but winds remain fresh at 13 mph S, so look for sheltered corners. Best: today.
