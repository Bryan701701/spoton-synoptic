Today in County Sligo, it's a quiet scene with 2 ft @8s NNW swell and fresh 18 mph E winds. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 2 ft @6s NNE swell and 21 mph ENE winds, keeping it blown out. On the day after, we see the same 2 ft @8s NNW swell but with lighter 6 mph ENE winds, still not producing. Best: day after.
