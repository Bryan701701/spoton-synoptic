Today in County Sligo, it's looking good with 4 ft @10s NW swell and light 11 mph SW winds. Strandhill and Easkey spots are clean and fun, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 6 ft @11s WNW swell but fresh 28 mph WNW winds will make it blown out across the board. Day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @6s SSW, still with fresh winds, keeping it poor. Best: today.
