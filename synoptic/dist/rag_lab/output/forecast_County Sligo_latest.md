Today in County Sligo, it's looking good with 4 ft @ 8s NNW swell and light 11 mph S winds. Dunmoran Strand and Easkey Left are your top picks, both working well throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 6 ft @ 8s NNW but the fresh 20 mph NNW wind will make conditions poor across the board. On the day after, expect a drop to 5 ft @ 9s NW with lighter 9 mph WSW winds, making for a fun surf day at spots like Dunmoran Strand and Easkey Left. Best: today.
