Today in County Sligo, it's a bit of a struggle with 2 ft @8s NNW swell and fresh 18 mph E winds making for a blown-out scene. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @6s NNE with winds increasing to 21 mph ENE, keeping conditions poor. On the day after, similar 2 ft @8s NNW swell returns but with lighter 6 mph ENE winds, offering a slight improvement. Best: day after.
