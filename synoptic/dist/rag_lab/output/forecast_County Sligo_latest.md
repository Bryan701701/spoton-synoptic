Today in County Sligo, surf is small at 2 ft @9s NNW with fresh 7 mph ENE wind, making it a bit choppy. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 2 ft @11s NNW, and while Dunmoran Strand and Lackan Bay are the better spots, expect some onshore texture. Day after drops to 2 ft @8s N, still with fresh ENE wind, keeping conditions less than ideal. Best: tomorrow.
