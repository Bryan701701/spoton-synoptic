County Sligo is looking solid today with 9 ft @ 17s WNW swell and light 12 mph SSE winds. Strandhill and Easkey Right are the top picks, both offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop with fresh 30 mph WSW winds making it blown out and poor across the board. The day after sees a further decrease to 5 ft @ 10s, still messy with 27 mph SSE winds. Best: today.
