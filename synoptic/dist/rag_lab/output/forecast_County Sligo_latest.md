Today in County Sligo, it's looking poor with 7 ft @9s NNW swell and fresh 21 mph NNW wind, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 5 ft @9s NW swell and light 1 mph SSE winds, offering clean options at spots like Dunmoran Strand and Easkey. The day after, we see a slight drop to 4 ft @9s NW, but with 7 mph SSW winds, it should still be fun at Strandhill and Easkey. Best: tomorrow.
