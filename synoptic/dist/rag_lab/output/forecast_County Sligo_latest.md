Today in County Sligo, it's looking great with 5 ft @11s WNW swell and light 7 mph SSW winds. Strandhill and Easkey spots are clean and working well, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 7 ft @14s WNW with fresh 20 mph SSE winds, making it blown out across the board. By the day after, expect 3 ft @12s WNW with 16 mph W winds; Strandhill may offer some workable waves. Best: today.
