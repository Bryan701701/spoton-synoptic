Today in County Sligo, it's a bit rough with 3 ft @10s WNW swell and fresh 22 mph SE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 6 ft @9s WNW swell but still fresh 20 mph SW winds, so expect it to remain messy. By the day after, the swell drops to 5 ft @9s W with stronger 25 mph S winds, keeping it challenging. Best: tomorrow.
