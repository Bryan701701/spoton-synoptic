Today in County Sligo, conditions are poor with 4 ft @9s WSW swell, but fresh 23 mph S winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, things improve with 10 ft @17s WNW swell and lighter 13 mph S winds, offering some workable options at Strandhill and Easkey. The day after continues with 10 ft @13s WNW swell, but stronger 25 mph WSW winds will keep it messy. Best: tomorrow.
