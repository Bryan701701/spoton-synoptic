Today in County Sligo, conditions are poor with 4 ft @10s WNW swell and fresh 18 mph S winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, expect a nice improvement with 5 ft @12s WNW swell and lighter 12 mph S winds, especially at Strandhill and Easkey. The day after, surf builds to 6 ft @12s WNW, still with 12 mph S winds, keeping it workable at Strandhill and Easkey. Best: tomorrow.
