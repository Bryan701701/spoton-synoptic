Today in County Sligo, we're looking at solid surf with 7 ft @ 14s WNW at Strandhill and Easkey spots, though the fresh 16 mph SSE wind adds some chop. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @ 11s WNW, still workable at Strandhill but not as exciting. By the day after, surf remains at 3 ft @ 9s WNW, with a light 11 mph SSE wind, making it a fun day at Strandhill and Easkey Left. Best: today.
