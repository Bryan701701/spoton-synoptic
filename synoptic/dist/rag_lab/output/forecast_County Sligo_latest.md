Today in County Sligo, Strandhill and Easkey spots are working well with a solid 7 ft @ 14s WNW swell and fresh 16 mph SSE winds. Expect some clean faces, especially at Strandhill during the tide window from 09:37 to 17:12. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 11s, still manageable but less exciting, with winds shifting to 15 mph S. By the day after, conditions improve slightly with 3 ft @ 9s, and a lighter 11 mph SSE wind, making it a fun option at Strandhill and Easkey Left. Best: today.
