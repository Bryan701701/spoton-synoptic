Today in County Sligo, it's looking good with 7 ft @ 14s WNW swell and fresh 16 mph SSE winds. Strandhill and Easkey spots are working well, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 11s WNW, still surfable at Strandhill but overall conditions will be less exciting. By the day after, conditions remain similar with 3 ft @ 9s WNW, but with lighter winds. Best: today.
