County Sligo is looking good today with 4 ft @11s WNW swell and light 7 mph S winds. Strandhill, Easkey Right, and Easkey Left are all clean and fun, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 6 ft @12s WNW swell but fresh 20 mph SSW winds will make it blown out. The day after, similar 4 ft @9s WSW swell continues but with 19 mph S winds, keeping it poor. Best: today.
