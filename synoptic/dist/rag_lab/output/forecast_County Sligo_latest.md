Today in County Sligo, we’ve got a solid 9 ft @ 17s WNW swell with light SSE winds at 12 mph. Strandhill and Easkey spots are clean and working well, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with a fresh 30 mph WSW wind making it blown out across the board. The day after sees a smaller 5 ft @ 10s WNW swell with continued fresh winds, keeping it poor. Best: today.
