Today in County Sligo, it's a bit of a struggle with 7 ft @9s NNW swell and fresh 21 mph NNW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve with a cleaner 5 ft @9s NW swell and light 1 mph SSE winds, offering some fun options at spots like Dunmoran Strand and Easkey. The day after, surf drops slightly to 4 ft @9s NW with a gentle 7 mph SSW breeze, still providing decent waves at Strandhill and Easkey. Best: tomorrow.
