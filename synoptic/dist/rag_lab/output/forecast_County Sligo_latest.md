Today in County Sligo, surf is looking solid at 5 ft @9s from the N with fresh 16 mph N winds. Good spots like Dunmoran Strand and Easkey Right are working well, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 4 ft @8s NNW swell and light 8 mph S winds, making for a cleaner day. The day after, expect similar 5 ft @8s NNW surf, but with a bit more wind at 13 mph NNW. Best: tomorrow.
