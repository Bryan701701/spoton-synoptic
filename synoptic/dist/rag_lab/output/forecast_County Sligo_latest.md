Today in County Sligo, it's looking poor with 6 ft @9s WNW swell, but fresh 20 mph SW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 5 ft @9s WSW swell and stronger 26 mph S winds, still not producing anything worthwhile. Day after, the swell picks up to 6 ft @14s WNW, but the 23 mph S winds will keep it messy. Best: day after.
