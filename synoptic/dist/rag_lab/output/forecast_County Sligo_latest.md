County Sligo is looking good! Today, expect 7 ft @ 13s WNW swell with fresh 15 mph S winds. Strandhill and Easkey spots are working, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 7 ft @ 11s WNW swell and lighter 8 mph S winds, making it a great day for a surf. By the day after, the swell drops to 4 ft @ 10s NW, still fun but less punchy. Best: tomorrow.
