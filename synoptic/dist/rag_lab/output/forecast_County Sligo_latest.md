Today in County Sligo, it's looking great with 4 ft @ 11s WNW swell and light 7 mph S winds. Strandhill and Easkey spots are clean and working well, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 6 ft @ 12s WNW but with fresh 20 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Day after, still 4 ft @ 9s WSW with 19 mph S winds, keeping it poor across the board. Best: today.
