County Sligo is looking solid! Today, enjoy 4 ft @10s NNW swell with a moderate 11 mph WNW wind. Good spots like Dunmoran Strand and Easkey Right are working well, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @9s NW with fresh 14 mph S winds, making it less inviting—Strandhill is your best bet. Day after, swell picks up to 8 ft @14s WNW, but with similar winds, it may be a bit messy; Easkey spots will be the go-to. Best: today.
