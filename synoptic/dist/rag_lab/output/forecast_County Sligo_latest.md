Today in County Sligo, it's looking good with 4 ft @ 12s WNW swell and light 4 mph NE winds. Strandhill and Easkey spots are both working well, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 11s, still clean but less powerful, with E winds at 5 mph. Day after brings back the 4 ft @ 12s NW swell with light 2 mph NNW winds, making for a fun day at the beaches. Best: today.
