Today in County Sligo, surf is looking good with 6 ft @12s WNW at Strandhill and Easkey spots, thanks to a fresh 17 mph SSW wind. Best windows are at Strandhill from 08:50 to 16:10, and Easkey Right from 08:51 to 10:04. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @10s with a stronger 22 mph S wind, making it less appealing. Day after, we see a solid swell of 10 ft @16s WNW, but with the same S wind at 13 mph, so look for sheltered spots. Best: today.
