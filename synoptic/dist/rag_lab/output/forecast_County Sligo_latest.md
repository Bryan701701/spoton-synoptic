Today in County Sligo, conditions are poor with a solid 7 ft @9s N swell but fresh 19 mph N winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 5 ft @9s N with light 3 mph NNW winds, offering some clean options at spots like Dunmoran Strand and Easkey Right. The day after, expect a slight increase to 6 ft @8s N, but winds pick up to 17 mph NNE, making it a bit choppy. Best: tomorrow.
