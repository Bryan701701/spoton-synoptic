Today in County Sligo, it's a bit rough with fresh N winds at 24 mph and 7 ft @ 9s swell, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, conditions worsen slightly with wind picking up to 28 mph, keeping the same swell size but still messy. By the day after, the swell drops to 4 ft @ 9s with lighter NNW winds at 13 mph, offering some workable options at spots like Dunmoran Strand and Easkey. Best: day after.
