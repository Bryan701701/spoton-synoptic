Today in County Sligo, conditions are poor with 3 ft @6s SW swell and fresh 21 mph S wind making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight increase to 4 ft @7s WNW, but the fresh 22 mph SSW wind keeps it messy. By the day after, we can expect a solid 8 ft @11s NNW swell with light 6 mph NNE winds, creating great conditions at spots like Dunmoran Strand and Easkey. Best: day after.
