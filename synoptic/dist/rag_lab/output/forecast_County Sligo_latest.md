Today in County Sligo, conditions are poor with 3 ft @6s SW swell and fresh 21 mph S wind, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight increase to 4 ft @7s WNW, but with similar fresh 22 mph SSW winds, it remains messy. On the day after, the swell jumps to a solid 8 ft @11s NNW with light 6 mph NNE winds, offering clean and fun surf at spots like Dunmoran Strand and Easkey. Best: day after.
