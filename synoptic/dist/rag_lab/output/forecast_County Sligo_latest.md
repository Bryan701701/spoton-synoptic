Today in County Sligo, it's looking solid with 5 ft @9s N swell and fresh 16 mph N winds. Good spots like Dunmoran Strand and Easkey Right are working well, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 4 ft @8s NNW, but with light 8 mph S winds, conditions will be clean and fun. On the day after, expect similar 5 ft @8s NNW swell with moderate 13 mph NNW winds, keeping it workable at sheltered spots. Best: tomorrow.
