Today in County Sligo, it's a solid day with 7 ft @10s NNW swell and fresh 11 mph NE winds. Dunmoran Strand and Easkey Right are your top picks, with the best windows for Dunmoran from 09:29 to 17:16. Tomorrow sees a drop to 5 ft @9s NNW, but still fun at spots like Easkey Left and Pollacheeny Harbour, with light SW winds. By the day after, conditions ease further to 3 ft @9s NW, with Strandhill and Easkey Left offering some workable waves despite the fresh SSW winds. Best: today.
