Today in County Sligo, it's a quiet day with 2 ft @9s NNW lines, but fresh ENE winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 2 ft @11s NNW swell; Dunmoran Strand and Lackan Bay should be the best bets, especially during the mid-day push. The day after, expect similar 2 ft @8s N swell, but conditions will remain poor across the board. Best: tomorrow.
