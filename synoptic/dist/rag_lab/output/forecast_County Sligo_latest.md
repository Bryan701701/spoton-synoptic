Today in County Sligo, it's a bit of a struggle with 4 ft @10s WNW swell, but fresh 21 mph SE winds are making it messy. Tomorrow sees a bump to 7 ft @15s WNW, still with fresh 20 mph ESE winds, so expect it to be blown out. Day after brings 4 ft @12s WNW with light 4 mph E winds, offering some clean options at spots like Strandhill and Easkey. Best: day after.
