Today in County Sligo, conditions are poor with a swell of 4 ft @10s from the WNW and a fresh 21 mph SE wind making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell increases to 7 ft @15s, but the wind remains fresh at 20 mph ESE, keeping it messy. On the day after, conditions improve with 4 ft @12s swell and light 4 mph E winds, making spots like Strandhill and Easkey Right more workable. Best: day after.
