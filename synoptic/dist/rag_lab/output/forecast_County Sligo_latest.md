Today in County Sligo, conditions are poor with 5 ft @9s WSW swell and fresh 26 mph S winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 7 ft @15s WNW swell, but the same fresh S winds will keep it messy. By the day after, the swell picks up to 8 ft @14s WNW, still with fresh S winds, but Strandhill and Easkey might offer some workable waves during the daylight hours. Best: day after.
