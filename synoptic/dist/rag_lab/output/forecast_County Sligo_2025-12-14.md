Today in County Sligo, it's a quiet one with 4 ft @10s WNW swell, but fresh 18 mph S winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 5 ft @12s WNW and lighter 12 mph S winds, offering some fun at spots like Strandhill and Easkey. The day after, expect 6 ft @12s WNW, still with 12 mph S winds, keeping things workable at the same locations. Best: tomorrow.
