Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it's looking good with 3 ft @10s WNW swell and fresh 17 mph ENE winds. Ballybunion Right and Ballybunion Beach are your best bets, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 3 ft @11s WNW swell and slightly lighter winds at 14 mph; still plenty of options at the same spots. By the day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @11s W, but it's still workable at sheltered corners like Coumeenole and Inch Strand. Best: today.
