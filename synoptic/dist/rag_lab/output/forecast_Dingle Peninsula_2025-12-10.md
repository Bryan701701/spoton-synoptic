Today, Dingle Peninsula is seeing poor conditions with 11 ft @10s WSW swell and fresh 32 mph WSW winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell increases to 13 ft @10s SW, but the wind picks up to a strong 43 mph S, keeping it messy. On the day after, the swell remains at 13 ft but with a slightly longer period of 13s, and winds ease to 25 mph SSW, still not ideal. Best: day after.
