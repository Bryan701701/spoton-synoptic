Today in Donegal, it's looking solid with 5 ft @9s WNW swell and moderate 11 mph WNW winds. Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are prime spots, offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, swell drops slightly to 4 ft @8s with 10 mph S winds, still producing fun waves at Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand. Day after, expect a bump up to 8 ft @13s, but with fresh 15 mph S winds, so look for sheltered corners to catch some rides. Best: today.
