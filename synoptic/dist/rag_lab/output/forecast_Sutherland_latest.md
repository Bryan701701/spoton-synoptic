Sutherland is looking fun today with clean 1 ft @10s N swell and a light 13 mph SE wind. Farr Bay and Sango Bay are the top picks, both offering good conditions on the mid-tide push. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 2 ft @4s SW swell and fresh 26 mph WSW wind, making it blown out. The day after continues the trend with 2 ft @9s W swell and 16 mph ESE wind, still not ideal. Best: today.
