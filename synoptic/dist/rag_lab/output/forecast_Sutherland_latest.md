Today in Sutherland, it's looking solid with 5 ft @16s WNW swell and fresh 17 mph ESE winds. Sandwood Bay is the top pick, but sheltered corners like Melvich and Strathy are also working well. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @12s, and with fresh 20 mph ESE winds, it might be a bit choppy—best to hit Sandwood Bay early. Day after, conditions ease with 2 ft @11s and light 9 mph SE winds, making for a fun day at spots like Melvich and Strathy. Best: today.
