Today in Sutherland, conditions are poor with a hefty swell of 7 ft @10s from the W, but fresh 28 mph SW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 6 ft @9s WSW, but the 26 mph SSE winds continue to create messy conditions. On the day after, expect an increase to 11 ft @14s W, with strong 32 mph SSW winds, resulting in challenging surf. Best: none.
