Today in Sutherland, clean surf at 4 ft @ 11s NNW with light 2 mph ENE winds. Great options at Melvich and Strathy, with the best windows around midday. Tomorrow, expect similar conditions with 4 ft @ 11s NNW and a bit more wind at 8 mph NE, still plenty of fun to be had. Day after, the swell picks up to 5 ft @ 12s N with SW winds, making for a solid session at spots like Melvich and Sango Bay. Best: day after.
