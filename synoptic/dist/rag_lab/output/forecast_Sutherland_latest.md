Sutherland is lighting up today with solid 7 ft @10s NW swell and fresh 16 mph WSW winds. Sango Bay is the top pick, working best from 08:59 to 15:56. Tomorrow, the swell remains at 7 ft but drops to 8s, with Sango Bay still holding up, though winds pick up to 21 mph. Day after, conditions drop to 4 ft @9s, and the wind shifts to 20 mph SSW, making it less inviting. Best: today.
