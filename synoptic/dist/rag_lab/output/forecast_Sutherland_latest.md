Sutherland is lighting up today with clean 3ft @14s WNW swell and fresh 25 mph SE winds. Best spots include Strathy and Sango Bay, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 4ft @7s E swell and strong 38 mph ESE winds, making it poor across the board. By the day after, things improve again with 3ft @11s WNW swell and lighter 16 mph ESE winds, making Balnakeil and Sandwood Bay more workable. Best: today.
