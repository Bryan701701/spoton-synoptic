Sutherland is looking good today with 3 ft @ 11s NNW swell and light 10 mph SSE winds. Melvich and Strathy are both solid picks, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 5 ft @ 12s W with a fresh 17 mph SE wind, so expect some fun conditions at spots like Sango Bay. By the day after, the swell eases to 4 ft @ 10s NW with light 8 mph SE winds, making for a mellow session. Best: tomorrow.
