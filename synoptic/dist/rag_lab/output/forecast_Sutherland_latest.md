Today in Sutherland, it's looking solid with 3 ft @14s WNW swell and fresh 25 mph SE winds. Melvich and Strathy are good picks, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @7s E with strong 38 mph ESE winds, making it poor across the board. By the day after, we see a return to 3 ft @11s WNW with lighter 16 mph ESE winds, offering some workable options at Balnakeil and Sandwood Bay. Best: today.
