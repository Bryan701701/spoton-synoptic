Today in Sutherland, surf is fun with 3ft @11s NNW and light 10 mph SSE winds. Good spots like Melvich and Strathy are working well, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 5ft @12s W with a moderate 17 mph SE wind, making for some punchy waves. On the day after, surf remains solid at 4ft @10s NW with light 8 mph SE winds, keeping it clean. Best: tomorrow.
