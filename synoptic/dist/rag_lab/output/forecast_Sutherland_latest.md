Today in Sutherland, conditions are poor with a swell of 4 ft @ 12s from the W and fresh 15 mph ESE winds. Tomorrow, the swell increases to 9 ft @ 8s from the SW, but strong 43 mph SW winds will make it blown out. The day after, the swell drops slightly to 8 ft @ 9s from the W with moderate 32 mph SSW winds, still not ideal. Best: today.
