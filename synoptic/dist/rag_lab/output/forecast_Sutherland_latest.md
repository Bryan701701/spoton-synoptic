Today in Sutherland, we've got a solid 5 ft @10s N swell with fresh 15 mph N winds. Sheltered corners like Melvich and Strathy are working well, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @9s N with light S winds, making for a fun day at spots like Melvich and Sango Bay. By the day after, we're looking at a 4 ft @11s WNW swell with similar S winds, keeping the surf lively. Best: tomorrow.
