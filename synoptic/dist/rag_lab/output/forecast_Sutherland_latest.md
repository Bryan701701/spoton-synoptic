Today in Sutherland, it's a no-go with 0 ft @ 0 s and calm N winds. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 8 ft @ 9 s WSW, but fresh 31 mph SSW winds will make it messy. By the day after, conditions get better with 8 ft @ 13 s W, and winds easing to 20 mph SSW, offering some good windows at spots like Sango Bay and Melvich. Best: day after.
