Today in Sutherland, clean 4 ft @ 11s NNW lines are rolling in with a moderate 11 mph SW wind. Good spots like Melvich and Strathy are working well, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, expect a bump to 5 ft @ 12s N with light 6 mph SE winds, making for fun conditions at several locations. By the day after, Sango Bay will be the standout with 4 ft @ 8s NNW, though fresh 26 mph W winds may create some chop. Best: tomorrow.
