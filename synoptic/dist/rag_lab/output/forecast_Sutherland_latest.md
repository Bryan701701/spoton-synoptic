Today in Sutherland, conditions are poor with a fresh 32 mph SW wind and 6 ft @11s WSW swell, making it blown out. Tomorrow remains similar with 6 ft @11s W swell and a lighter 11 mph SSE wind, but still not producing. Day after, the swell drops to 4 ft @14s W with a 20 mph SE wind, offering some cleaner options at spots like Sango Bay. Best: day after.
