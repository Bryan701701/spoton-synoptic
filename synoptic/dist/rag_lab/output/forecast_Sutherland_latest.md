Sutherland is looking good today with 3ft @11s NNW swell and light 10 mph SSE winds. Melvich and Strathy are your top picks, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 5ft @12s W with a moderate 17 mph SE wind, making for some fun conditions, especially at Sango Bay and Armadale Bay. Day after, it settles to 4ft @10s NW with light 8 mph SE winds, still offering solid surf at various spots. Best: tomorrow.
