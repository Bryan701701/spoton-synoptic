Today in Sutherland, it's looking poor with 13 ft @11s N swell and a fresh 40 mph N wind, making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 9 ft @10s N with the wind easing to 28 mph N, but still not producing anything worthwhile. Day after, conditions remain similar with 9 ft @9s N and 24 mph NNW wind, keeping the surf quality low. Best: none.
