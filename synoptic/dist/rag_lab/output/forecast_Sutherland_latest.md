Today in Sutherland, it's looking poor with 0 ft @0s and no swell hitting the coast. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 7 ft @11s WSW but fresh 39 mph SW winds will keep it blown out. Day after, the swell drops slightly to 6 ft @11s with 22 mph S winds, still not producing anything worthwhile. Best: none.
