Sutherland is lighting up today with 5 ft @ 16s WNW swell and fresh 17 mph ESE winds. Good spots like Sandwood Bay and Sango Bay are offering fun conditions, especially around their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @ 12s with 20 mph ESE winds, making it less inviting. By the day after, we see a further drop to 2 ft @ 11s, but with lighter 9 mph SE winds, it could be more manageable at sheltered spots. Best: today.
