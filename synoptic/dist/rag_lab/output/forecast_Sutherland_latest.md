Today in Sutherland, it's a quiet day with no surf energy—wrong swell angle and fresh ESE winds at 26 mph. Tomorrow brings a slight improvement with 1 ft @ 9s N swell; Farr Bay and Sango Bay may offer some fun, especially during the mid-tide push. Day after, conditions drop again with 2 ft @ 5s SW swell but fresh WSW winds will make it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
