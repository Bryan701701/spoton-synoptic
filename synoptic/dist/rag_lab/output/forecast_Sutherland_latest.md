Sutherland is looking good today with clean 2ft @11s W swell and light SSE winds. Melvich and Strathy are your top picks, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 5ft @13s WNW with light S winds, making it a solid day for surf. Day after, expect 4ft @12s WNW, still clean and fun. Best: tomorrow.
