Today in Sutherland, it's a no-go with fresh SW winds at 32 mph making for blown-out conditions and 6 ft @11s WSW swell. Tomorrow, similar swell persists at 6 ft @11s W, but winds ease to 11 mph SSE, still not producing anything worthwhile. Day after, conditions improve with 4 ft @14s W swell and 20 mph SE winds, offering a better chance at fun waves, especially around the mid-tide windows. Best: day after.
