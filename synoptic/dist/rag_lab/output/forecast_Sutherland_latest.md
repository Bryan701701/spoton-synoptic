Today in Sutherland, surf is looking solid with 6 ft @8s NNW and fresh 15 mph NNE winds. Good spots like Melvich and Strathy are working well, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions improve with a more manageable 3 ft @8s WNW swell and light SSE winds, making it a great day for a session. The day after brings a bit more power with 4 ft @11s WNW, still clean and fun. Best: tomorrow.
