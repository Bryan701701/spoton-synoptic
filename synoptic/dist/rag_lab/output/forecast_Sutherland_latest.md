Today in Sutherland, it's looking solid with 4 ft @ 11s NNW swell and light 2 mph ENE winds. Good spots like Melvich and Strathy are working well, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, expect similar conditions with the same swell size but a slight increase in wind to 8 mph NE, keeping the surf fun and lively. By the day after, the swell bumps up to 5 ft @ 12s N, with a steady 8 mph SW wind, making for some exciting rides. Best: day after.
