Sutherland is lighting up today with clean 4 ft @11s NNW swell and light 2 mph ENE winds. Melvich and Strathy are your go-to spots, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell remains steady at 4 ft @11s NNW, but winds pick up to 8 mph NE, still offering good conditions at the same spots. On the day after, swell increases to 5 ft @12s N, with SW winds at 8 mph, keeping the surf fun and lively. Best: day after.
