Today in Sutherland, it's looking solid with 4 ft @ 12s W swell and fresh 23 mph ESE winds. Good spots like Melvich and Strathy are firing, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 10s WNW with lighter 9 mph SSW winds, making for a quieter day. By the day after, we're back to 5 ft @ 12s WNW with light 9 mph N winds, perfect for some fun sessions at spots like Melvich and Sango Bay. Best: day after.
