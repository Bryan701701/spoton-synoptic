Today in Sutherland is quiet with no surf; the swell isn’t getting in and the wind is fresh onshore at 24 mph. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with a strong 9 ft @8s SW swell but it will be blown out by 37 mph SW winds. On the day after, Strathy shows some promise with 10 ft @10s NW swell and lighter 14 mph W winds, making it the best option. Best: day after.
