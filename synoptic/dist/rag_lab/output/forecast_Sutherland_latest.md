Today in Sutherland, Balnakeil and Oldshoremore are both working with 3ft @8s WNW swell and fresh 22 mph NNE winds. Expect some fun, peaky waves, especially between 09:10 and 15:32. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 4ft @10s NNW swell and light 1 mph N winds, making it a great day for a surf. The day after, it drops back to 3ft @10s NNW with moderate 12 mph NNW winds, still offering some rideable waves. Best: tomorrow.
