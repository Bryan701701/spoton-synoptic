Sutherland is lighting up today with solid 4ft @12s W swell and fresh 23 mph ESE winds. Best spots include Melvich and Strathy, both offering clean conditions early on. Tomorrow sees a drop to 2ft @10s WNW, but still workable at Farr Bay and Sango Bay with light 9 mph SSW winds. Day after, the swell picks back up to 5ft @12s WNW with light N winds, making it a great day for Melvich and Strathy again. Best: day after.
