Today in Sutherland, it's a flat day with no surf—just calm conditions. Tomorrow, expect a solid 8 ft @14s W swell with winds at 19 mph S; Strathy and Sandwood Bay should be the go-to spots during the mid-tide push. The day after, the swell remains at 8 ft @12s W but fresh SW winds at 37 mph will make it blown out and poor across the board. Best: tomorrow.
