Today in Sutherland, it's a quiet start with no surf action—wrong swell angle and fresh NNW wind at 25 mph. Tomorrow, Sango Bay lights up with a workable 4 ft @8s N swell, though expect some chop from the 28 mph WNW wind. The day after, conditions improve slightly with 4 ft @7s NNW swell, and lighter winds at 13 mph, making for a better session at spots like Melvich and Strathy. Best: tomorrow.
