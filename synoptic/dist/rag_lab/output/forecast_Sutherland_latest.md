Sutherland is lighting up today with Sango Bay offering 7 ft @ 10s NNW and fresh 19 mph NNW winds. It's a solid day for those looking to catch some powerful waves, especially during the mid-tide push from 09:39 to 16:34. Tomorrow, conditions ease to 6 ft @ 10s N with lighter 8 mph NNE winds, making for a fun, manageable surf across several spots. By the day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 7s W, still workable but a bit softer. Best: today.
