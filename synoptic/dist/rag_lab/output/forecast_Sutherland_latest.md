Sutherland is looking fun today with 1 ft @10s N swell and a light 13 mph SE wind. Farr Bay and Sango Bay are your best bets, especially during their mid-tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 2 ft @4s SW swell and fresh 26 mph WSW winds, making it poor across the board. The day after continues the trend with 2 ft @9s W swell and 16 mph ESE winds, keeping things on the poor side. Best: today.
