Sutherland is lighting up today with 4 ft @12s WNW swell and light 4 mph ESE winds. Melvich and Strathy are both clean and fun, with prime tides for catching waves. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 3 ft @11s, but still plenty of options with similar conditions. By the day after, expect 3 ft @7s NW, though winds pick up to 21 mph NNE, making it a bit choppy. Best: today.
