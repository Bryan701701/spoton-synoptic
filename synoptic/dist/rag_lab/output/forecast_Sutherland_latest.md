Today in Sutherland, it’s a quiet day with no surf action—swell isn’t hitting this coast and the wind is fresh onshore at 26 mph. Tomorrow brings a slight improvement with 1 ft @ 9s N swell at Farr Bay and Sango Bay, with light SE winds making for a fun morning session. The day after, conditions drop again with 2 ft @ 5s SW swell but fresh WSW winds will likely blow it out. Best: tomorrow.
