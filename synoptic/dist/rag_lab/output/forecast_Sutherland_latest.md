Today in Sutherland, it’s a quiet day with no surf action; the swell isn’t hitting this coast. Tomorrow, Sango Bay lights up with 4 ft @8s N and fresh 28 mph WNW winds, making it the best spot to catch some fun waves. On the day after, conditions ease slightly with 4 ft @7s NNW, and winds drop to a lighter 13 mph, offering a workable session at several spots like Melvich and Strathy. Best: tomorrow.
