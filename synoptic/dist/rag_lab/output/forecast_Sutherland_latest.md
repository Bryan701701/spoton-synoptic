Sutherland is lighting up today with clean 3ft @14s WNW swell and a fresh 25 mph SE wind. Great options include Melvich and Strathy, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 4ft @7s E swell and strong 38 mph ESE winds, making it poor across the board. On the day after, we see a return to 3ft @11s WNW with lighter 16 mph ESE winds, offering some fun at spots like Balnakeil and Sandwood Bay. Best: today.
