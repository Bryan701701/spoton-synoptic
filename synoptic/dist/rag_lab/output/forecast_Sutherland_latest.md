Today in Sutherland, it's a no-go with poor conditions: 11 ft @ 10s NNW swell and fresh 35 mph NNW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, similar story with 11 ft @ 11s N swell and 23 mph NNE winds, still not producing. Day after, conditions drop slightly to 9 ft @ 10s N with 37 mph N winds, keeping it messy. Best: none.
