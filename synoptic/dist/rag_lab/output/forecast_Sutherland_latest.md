Today in Sutherland, it's a tough call with 13 ft @11s WSW swell and fresh 42 mph SW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions remain challenging with 8 ft @9s WSW swell and 31 mph SSW winds, still not producing anything worthwhile. However, day after looks promising with 8 ft @13s W swell and 20 mph SSW winds, offering clean surf at spots like Melvich and Sango Bay during the mid-tide windows. Best: day after.
