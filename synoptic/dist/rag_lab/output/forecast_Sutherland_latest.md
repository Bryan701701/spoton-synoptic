Sutherland is looking solid today with Sango Bay offering 7 ft @10s NW swell and 16 mph WSW winds—best during the mid-tide push from 08:59 to 15:56. Tomorrow, Sango Bay remains the standout with similar swell but winds picking up to 21 mph, making it a bit choppy. By the day after, conditions drop to 4 ft @9s, with fresh SSW winds making it less appealing. Best: today.
