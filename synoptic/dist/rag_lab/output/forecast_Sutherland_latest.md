Sutherland is looking solid today with 3 ft @10s N swell and a fresh 16 mph SE wind. Melvich and Strathy are both working well, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell shifts to 3 ft @14s NW with a stronger 20 mph ESE wind, but it’s mainly poor across most spots. Day after drops to 2 ft @7s ENE with a strong 38 mph ESE wind, making it a no-go. Best: today.
