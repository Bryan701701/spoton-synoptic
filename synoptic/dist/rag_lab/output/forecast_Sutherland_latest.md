Sutherland is looking solid over the next three days! Today, expect clean conditions with 5 ft @12s W swell and light 7 mph WSW wind. Melvich and Strathy are prime spots, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell remains the same, but the wind shifts to 8 mph SSE, keeping it fun at the same good spots. On the day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @11s WNW, still workable with light S winds. Best: today.
