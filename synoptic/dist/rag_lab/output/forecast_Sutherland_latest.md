Today in Sutherland, it's a no-go with 9 ft @8s SW swell and a strong 44 mph SSW wind creating poor conditions. Tomorrow sees an improvement with 7 ft @11s NW swell and 25 mph WSW wind, making for some good surf at spots like Sango Bay and Melvich during the mid-tide push. The day after also looks promising with similar conditions, but only Sango Bay remains the standout. Best: tomorrow.
