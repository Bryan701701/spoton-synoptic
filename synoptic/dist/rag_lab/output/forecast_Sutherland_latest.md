Sutherland is looking solid today with clean 3 ft @10s W swell and a light 14 mph SSE wind. Best spots include Melvich and Strathy, both offering fun conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 3 ft @6s SW swell and fresh 29 mph S winds, making it poor for surfing. The day after also remains poor with 5 ft @7s SW swell and similar winds. Best: today.
