Today in Sutherland, it's looking poor with 11 ft @ 10s NNW swell, but fresh 35 mph NNW winds are blowing it out. Tomorrow, the swell remains at 11 ft @ 11s N, with winds easing to 23 mph NNE, but conditions will still be challenging. On the day after, the swell drops slightly to 9 ft @ 10s N, but fresh 37 mph N winds continue to disrupt the surf. Best: tomorrow.
