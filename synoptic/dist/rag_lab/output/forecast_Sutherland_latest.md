Today, Sutherland is lighting up with 3ft @12s W swell and a light 9 mph SSE wind. Melvich and Strathy are prime spots, both offering fun conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2ft @9s WNW with a fresh 18 mph NNE wind, making it less inviting; only Balnakeil and Oldshoremore will be workable. By the day after, conditions improve again with 3ft @9s NNW swell and light 3 mph SSE winds, making for a clean surf day at spots like Melvich and Strathy. Best: today.
