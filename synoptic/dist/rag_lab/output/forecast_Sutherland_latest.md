Today in Sutherland, Farr Bay and Sango Bay are both clean and fun at 1ft @10s N, with a light SE breeze at 13 mph. Ideal conditions are on the push from 08:51 to 15:26. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 2ft @4s SW and fresh 26 mph WSW winds, leading to blown-out surf. The day after, similar 2ft @9s W swell with 16 mph ESE winds keeps it poor across the board. Best: today.
