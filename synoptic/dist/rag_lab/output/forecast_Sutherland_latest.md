Today in Sutherland, it’s a no-go with poor conditions: 13 ft @11s N swell and a fresh 40 mph N wind. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 9 ft @10s, but the wind remains fresh at 28 mph, keeping it messy. The day after, conditions stay similar with 9 ft @9s N swell and 24 mph NNW wind, still not producing anything worthwhile. Best: none.
