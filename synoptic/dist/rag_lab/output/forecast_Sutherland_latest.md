Today in Sutherland, it's looking solid with 8 ft @ 13s W swell and 22 mph S winds. Melvich and Strathy are your best bets, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 11 ft @ 13s W with fresh 35 mph SW winds, making it blown out across the board. The day after, still poor with 9 ft @ 11s W and similar winds. Best: today.
