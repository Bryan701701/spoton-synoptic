Today in The South, it's a quiet day with 1 ft @6s SSW swell and fresh 18 mph WSW wind, making for blown-out conditions. Tomorrow remains similar with 1 ft @6s SW and light 6 mph WNW winds, so still not producing much. However, day after, we see a nice improvement with 2 ft @7s SW and light 2 mph N winds, creating clean and fun waves at spots like Derrynane and Barley Cove. Best: day after.
