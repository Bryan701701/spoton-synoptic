Today in The South, it’s a quiet scene with 1 ft @ 6s SSW swell and fresh 18 mph WSW wind. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 1 ft @ 6s SW and light 6 mph WNW wind, still not producing much. Day after, the swell picks up to 2 ft @ 7s SW with light 2 mph N winds, making it a good day at spots like Derrynane and Barley Cove. Best: day after.
