Today in Donegal, it's a challenging surf day with 14 ft @13s W swell, but fresh 35 mph WSW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a drop to 7 ft @11s W with 29 mph SE winds, still not ideal. However, the day after looks promising with 11 ft @15s W and light 8 mph E winds, offering some clean conditions at spots like Mageroaty and Bloody Foreland. Best: day after.
