Today in South Devon, it's a quiet one with 1 ft @8s SW swell and light N winds. Tomorrow stays similar, with 1 ft @5s WNW and fresh onshore winds making it less than ideal. However, on the day after, Bantham lights up with 2 ft @5s WSW and light NNW winds, offering a better chance for some fun waves. Best: day after.
