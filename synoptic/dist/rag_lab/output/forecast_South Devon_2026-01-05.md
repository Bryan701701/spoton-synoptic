Today in South Devon, it's looking pretty quiet with 1 ft @8s SW swell and light N winds. Tomorrow stays similar, with 1 ft @5s WNW swell and a bit of a fresh WNW breeze; not much to write home about. However, day after brings a little life with 2 ft @5s WSW at Bantham, especially during the tide window from 08:14 to 16:29. Best: day after.
