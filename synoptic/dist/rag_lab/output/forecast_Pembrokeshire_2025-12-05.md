Today in Pembrokeshire, it's looking great with 6 ft @9s WSW swell and light 9 mph SSW winds. Spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are clean and fun, especially during the mid-tide push. Tomorrow, conditions drop significantly with 10 ft @12s WSW swell and fresh 30 mph WSW winds, making it blown out and poor across the board. On the day after, the swell settles to 5 ft @11s WSW with a light 10 mph SE breeze, bringing back some clean options at places like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay. Best: today.
