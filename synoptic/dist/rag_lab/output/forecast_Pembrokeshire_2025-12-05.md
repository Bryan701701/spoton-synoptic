Today in Pembrokeshire, it’s a solid 6 ft @9s WSW with light 9 mph SSW winds. Great conditions at spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay, especially on the mid-tide push. Tomorrow, expect a significant drop to 10 ft @12s WSW with fresh 30 mph WSW winds, making it blown out and poor across the board. The day after brings cleaner 5 ft @11s WSW with 10 mph SE winds, perfect for a fun session at sheltered spots. Best: today.
