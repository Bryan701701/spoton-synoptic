Today in Pembrokeshire, it’s a solid 6 ft @9s WSW with light 9 mph SSW winds, making for clean conditions at spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay. Tomorrow, expect a significant increase to 10 ft @12s WSW, but fresh 30 mph WSW winds will make it blown out and poor across the board. On the day after, conditions improve with 5 ft @11s WSW and light 10 mph SE winds, offering a fun surf day at sheltered corners. Best: today.
