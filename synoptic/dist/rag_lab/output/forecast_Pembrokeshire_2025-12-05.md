Today in Pembrokeshire, it's looking great with 6 ft @9s WSW swell and light 9 mph SSW winds. Spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are clean and fun, especially on the mid-tide push. Tomorrow, conditions take a turn with 10 ft @12s WSW swell and fresh 30 mph WSW winds, making it blown out and unworkable. By the day after, things settle back to 5 ft @11s WSW with 10 mph SE winds, offering a good chance for fun waves again. Best: today.
