Sutherland is looking good! Today offers clean 3ft @11s NNW swell with light 10 mph SSE winds. Best spots include Melvich and Strathy, both working well throughout the day. Tomorrow, we see a bump to 5ft @12s W with fresh 17 mph SE winds, so expect some fun conditions at sheltered corners. Day after, the swell eases to 4ft @10s NW with light 8 mph SE winds, keeping it friendly. Best: tomorrow.
