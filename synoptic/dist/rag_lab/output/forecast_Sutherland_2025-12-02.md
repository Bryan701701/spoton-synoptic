Today in Sutherland, it’s a fun 3 ft @ 11s NNW with light SSE winds. Good spots like Melvich and Strathy are working well, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, we see a solid increase to 5 ft @ 12s W with fresh SE winds, making it a bit choppy but still worth checking out. On the day after, conditions ease back to 4 ft @ 10s NW with light SE winds, providing a cleaner surf experience. Best: tomorrow.
