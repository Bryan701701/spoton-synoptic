Sutherland is looking good today with 3 ft @ 11s NNW swell and light 10 mph SSE winds. Melvich and Strathy are prime spots, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, expect a solid increase to 5 ft @ 12s W with fresh 17 mph SE winds, so it’ll be a bit choppy but still fun at sheltered spots like Sango Bay. Day after, conditions ease back to 4 ft @ 10s NW with light 8 mph SE winds, making it a great day for a surf session. Best: tomorrow.
