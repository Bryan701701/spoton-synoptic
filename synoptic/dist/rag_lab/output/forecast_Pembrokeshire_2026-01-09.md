Today in Pembrokeshire, surf is looking good with 4 ft @ 8s W and fresh 17 mph NW winds. Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are both clean and fun, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 4 ft @ 9s WSW and light 9 mph N winds, making it a great day for a session at any of the prime spots. Day after, however, winds ramp up to 30 mph SSE with only 3 ft @ 5s S, leading to poor conditions across the board. Best: tomorrow.
