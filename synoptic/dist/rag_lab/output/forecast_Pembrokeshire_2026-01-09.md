Today in Pembrokeshire, surf is looking good with 4 ft @ 8s W across multiple spots, including Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay, both working well with fresh 17 mph NW winds. Tomorrow, conditions improve further with 4 ft @ 9s WSW and lighter 9 mph N winds, making it a prime day for all levels at spots like Freshwater West and St Brides Bay. Day after, expect 3 ft @ 5s S with strong 30 mph SSE winds, leading to poor conditions across the board. Best: tomorrow.
