Today in County Clare, it's looking pretty quiet with 1 ft @11s W swell and light ESE winds. Tomorrow sees a slight increase to 2 ft @8s WNW, but fresh 18 mph WNW winds will make it challenging. The day after continues with 2 ft @6s NW, but winds pick up to 22 mph N, making for a blown-out session. Best: tomorrow.
