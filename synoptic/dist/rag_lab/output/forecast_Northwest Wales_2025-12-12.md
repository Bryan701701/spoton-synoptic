Northwest Wales is looking great today with 3 ft @ 12s WSW swell and light 3 mph NW winds. Porth Oer and Hells Mouth (beach) are prime spots, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 3 ft @ 9s WSW with a moderate 9 mph S wind, still offering fun conditions at the same spots. Day after, conditions worsen with 5 ft @ 7s WSW and fresh 18 mph SSW winds, making it less appealing. Best: today.
