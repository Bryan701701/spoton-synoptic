Today sees poor conditions across the North East with 5 ft @8s N swell, but fresh 25 mph WNW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow improves slightly with 3 ft @8s NNE, though still affected by 17 mph WSW winds; sheltered spots like Saltburn Beach may offer some fun. Day after, conditions drop again to 5 ft @6s N with strong 36 mph NNW winds, making it challenging. Best: tomorrow.
