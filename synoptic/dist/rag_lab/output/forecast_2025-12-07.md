Today on the West Coast, Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay are clean and fun, with 4 ft @ 12s W and a moderate 15 mph S wind. Ideal times are from 08:41 to 15:52 for Ardnave and 08:41 to 13:06, then 14:36 to 15:53 for Saligo. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @ 8s W with fresh 25 mph SSW winds, making it poor across the board. The day after, the swell picks up to 6 ft @ 10s SW but will be blown out by strong 41 mph SE winds. Best: today.
