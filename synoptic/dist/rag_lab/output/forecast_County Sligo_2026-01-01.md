Today in County Sligo, it's a solid day with 5 ft @8s NNW swell and light 10 mph NNW winds. Dunmoran Strand and Easkey Right are looking great, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 7 ft @9s N with fresh 17 mph NNE winds, making it a bit choppy but still worth checking out at the right spots. By the day after, conditions drop with 7 ft @9s N swell but strong 24 mph N winds, leading to poor surf across the board. Best: today.
