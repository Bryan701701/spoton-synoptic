Today in County Sligo, it's a solid day with 5 ft @ 8s NNW swell and light 10 mph NNW winds. Dunmoran Strand and Easkey Right are both looking good, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, expect a bump to 7 ft @ 9s N with fresh 17 mph NNE winds, so it might be a bit choppy. The day after, conditions worsen with 24 mph N winds making it poor across the board. Best: today.
