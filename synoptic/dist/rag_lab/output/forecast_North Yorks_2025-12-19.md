Today in North Yorks, it's a quiet scene with 2 ft @4s SSW swell, but fresh 31 mph SW winds are making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow drops to 1 ft @4s SSW, still with 16 mph SSW winds, so not much to ride. Day after shows a slight improvement with 2 ft @4s ESE swell and lighter 13 mph ESE winds, offering some workable options at spots like Whitby Beach and Filey during the tide windows. Best: day after.
