Today in North Yorks, it's a bit of a struggle with 2 ft @4s SSW lines and fresh 31 mph SW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow drops to 1 ft @4s SSW with 16 mph SSW winds, so not much happening there either. On the day after, conditions improve slightly with 2 ft @4s ESE and lighter 13 mph ESE winds, making it workable at select spots like Withernsea and Filey during the tide windows. Best: day after.
