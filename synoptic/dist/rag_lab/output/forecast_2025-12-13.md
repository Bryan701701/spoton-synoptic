Today on the West Coast, it’s a bit rough with 8 ft @13s W swell and fresh 26 mph SSW wind, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees a drop to 5 ft @10s W with 25 mph S wind, still not producing much. By the day after, conditions improve with 6 ft @12s W swell and lighter 12 mph SW wind, offering some fun options at spots like Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay. Best: day after.
