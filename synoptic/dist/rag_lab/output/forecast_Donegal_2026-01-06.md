Today in Donegal, conditions are poor with a swell of 4 ft @ 6s WNW and fresh 20 mph SW winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, expect a nice improvement with 3 ft @ 8s WNW and light 8 mph NW winds at spots like Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand, offering some clean options. The day after looks even better, with 6 ft @ 9s WNW and light winds, perfect for a solid surf session at various beaches. Best: day after.
