Today in Sutherland, it's a quiet day with no surf action—wrong swell angle and fresh SSW winds at 30 mph are making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve with swell building to 8 ft @14s W, and Strathy and Sandwood Bay are looking good with moderate S winds at 19 mph. The day after, the swell remains at 8 ft @12s W, but fresh SW winds at 37 mph will chop things up again. Best: tomorrow.
