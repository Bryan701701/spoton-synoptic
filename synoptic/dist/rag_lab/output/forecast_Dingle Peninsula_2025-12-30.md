Dingle Peninsula is looking fun today with 2 ft @11s WNW swell and moderate 14 mph E winds. Ballybunion Right and Ballybunion Beach are your best bets during the tide window from 08:49 to 16:32. Tomorrow, the swell holds at 2 ft but drops to 10s, with fresh 17 mph SE winds making it a bit choppy. On New Year's Day, conditions improve with 2 ft @9s WNW and light 9 mph NW winds, creating a cleaner surf experience. Best: day after.
