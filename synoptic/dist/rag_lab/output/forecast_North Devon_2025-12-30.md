Today in North Devon, it's a quiet surf scene with 1 ft @ 7s NNE across the board, and light E winds adding a bit of chop. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 1 ft @ 12s W swell, but the wind eases to a light SSE, still not producing much action. Day after, things pick up slightly to 2 ft @ 5s WNW with fresh 17 mph WNW winds, making for a workable session at spots like Woolacombe and Croyde Beach. Best: day after.
