Today, Moray is seeing poor conditions with a weak 2 ft @4s SW swell and fresh 15 mph SSW winds across all spots. Tomorrow, the same story continues with 2 ft @4s WSW swell and 13 mph SSW winds, keeping it uninviting. However, day after tomorrow brings a slight improvement with 1 ft @9s NE swell at Spey Bay and Lossiemouth, both offering some workable options with 11 mph SSW winds. Best: day after.
