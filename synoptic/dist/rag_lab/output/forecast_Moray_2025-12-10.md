Today in Moray, it's looking pretty quiet with a weak 2 ft @4s SW swell and fresh 15 mph SSW winds. Tomorrow stays similar with the same 2 ft @4s WSW swell and 13 mph SSW winds—still not producing much. However, day after brings a little life with 1 ft @9s NE at Spey Bay and Lossiemouth, both with 11 mph SSW winds—best during the mid-tide push. Best: day after.
