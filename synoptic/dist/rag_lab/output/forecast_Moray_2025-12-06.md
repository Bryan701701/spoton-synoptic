Today in Moray, conditions are poor with a 3 ft @5s ESE swell and fresh 36 mph ESE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow looks much better as the swell drops to 2 ft @8s ENE with light 9 mph SW winds, providing clean options at spots like Fraserburgh and Lossiemouth. The day after, the swell remains at 2 ft @7s ENE, but with a slight increase in wind to 12 mph SSW, making it workable mainly at Spey Bay and Lossiemouth. Best: tomorrow.
