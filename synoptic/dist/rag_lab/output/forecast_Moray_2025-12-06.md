Today in Moray, it's a no-go with the swell not hitting and fresh ESE winds at 36 mph making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 2 ft @ 8s ENE swell and light SW winds, making for some fun, clean options at spots like Fraserburgh and Lossiemouth. The day after, expect similar 2 ft @ 7s ENE swell but with a bit more wind, so it may be a touch choppy. Best: tomorrow.
