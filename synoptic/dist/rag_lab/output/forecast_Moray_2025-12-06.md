Today in Moray, it's a bit rough with 3 ft @5s ESE swell and fresh 36 mph ESE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve with 2 ft @8s ENE swell and light 9 mph SW winds, making for a cleaner day at spots like Fraserburgh and Lossiemouth. The day after, it stays similar with 2 ft @7s ENE swell but with slightly stronger winds at 12 mph SSW, still workable at Spey Bay and Lossiemouth. Best: tomorrow.
