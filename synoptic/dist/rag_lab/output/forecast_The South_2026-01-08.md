Today, the South is quiet with weak 2 ft @7s lines and light NNW wind. Tomorrow, conditions improve as swell builds to 3 ft @9s with moderate WNW winds, making for a fun day at spots like Ballinskelligs Bay. The day after, the swell drops back to 2 ft @8s, but fresh W winds will make it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
