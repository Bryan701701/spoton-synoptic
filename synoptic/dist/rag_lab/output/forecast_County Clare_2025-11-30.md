County Clare is looking solid today with 4 ft @ 9s W swell and light 8 mph WNW winds. Lahinch Beach and Lahinch Left are prime spots, both working well from 09:26 to 17:25. Tomorrow, conditions ease a bit to 3 ft @ 8s W with fresh 13 mph S winds, still offering some fun at sheltered spots like Lahinch. Day after, we see a big jump to 10 ft @ 14s W, with clean conditions at various spots including Lahinch and Doolin Point. Best: today.
