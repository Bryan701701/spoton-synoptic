Today in South Devon, conditions are poor with 3 ft @5s SSW swell, but fresh 30 mph SSE winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 6 ft @8s SW swell, though winds remain fresh at 25 mph SW, keeping it messy. By the day after, conditions get better with 4 ft @9s SW swell and lighter 12 mph S winds, making it more workable at spots like Bovisand Reef and Bantham. Best: day after.
