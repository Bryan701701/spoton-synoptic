Today, Gower is lighting up with solid 7 ft @ 12s WSW swell and a light 11 mph NW wind. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are your top picks, both working well throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 6 ft @ 12s with a fresh 17 mph SW wind, making it a bit choppy but still surfable at the same spots. Day after, conditions worsen with 7 ft @ 8s and a strong 23 mph SSW wind, leading to poor surf. Best: today.
