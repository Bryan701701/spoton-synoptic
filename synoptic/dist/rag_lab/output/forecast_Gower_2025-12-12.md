Gower is lighting up today with solid 7ft @12s WSW swell and light 11 mph NW winds. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are your top picks, both working well from 08:14 to 16:07. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 6ft @12s with fresh 17 mph SW winds, but still some fun options at the same spots. Day after, conditions worsen with 7ft @8s and strong 23 mph SSW winds, making it a no-go. Best: today.
