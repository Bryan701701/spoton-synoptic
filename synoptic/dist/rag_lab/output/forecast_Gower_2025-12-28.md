Today in Gower, surf is on the small side at 2 ft @6s with a fresh 14 mph E wind, making it a bit blown out. Tomorrow drops to 1 ft @10s with a moderate 19 mph E wind, so it's not producing much. The day after sees a slight bump back to 2 ft @8s, but with a fresh 22 mph ENE wind, it’ll likely be messy. Best: today.
