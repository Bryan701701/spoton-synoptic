Today in Donegal, it's looking fun with 3 ft @10s W swell and light E winds at 9 mph. Magheroaty Beach and Mageroaty are both holding shape nicely, so grab your board! Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 5 ft @12s WNW with similar winds, making for a solid surf day. By the day after, conditions ease to 2–3 ft @11s WNW, but with fresh ESE winds at 15 mph, it might be a bit choppy. Best: tomorrow.
