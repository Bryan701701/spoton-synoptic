Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a solid 7 ft @ 9s WSW with a light 9 mph SW wind. Great conditions at spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay, both offering fun waves throughout the day. Tomorrow, expect a drop to 4 ft @ 11s WSW, still clean and workable with light winds. Day after, the swell bumps back up to 6 ft @ 9s WSW, but with a moderate 12 mph W wind, so look for sheltered corners. Best: today.
