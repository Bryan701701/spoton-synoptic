Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a solid 7 ft @ 9s WSW with a light 9 mph SW wind, making for clean conditions at spots like Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @ 11s, still fun but a bit softer, and winds remain light at 7 mph. By the day after, we see a slight increase to 6 ft @ 9s, but with a fresh 12 mph W wind, so expect some chop. Best: today.
