Today in Pembrokeshire, it's looking solid with 7 ft @9s WSW swell and light 9 mph SW winds. Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay are prime spots, offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @11s, still fun but a bit softer, with similar winds. By the day after, expect 6 ft @9s, but winds pick up to 12 mph W, making it a bit choppy. Best: today.
