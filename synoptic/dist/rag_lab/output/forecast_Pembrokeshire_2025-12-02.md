Today in Pembrokeshire, it's a solid 7 ft @ 9s WSW with a light 9 mph SW wind. Great conditions at Abereiddy and Whitesands Bay, both offering fun peaks throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @ 11s, still clean and workable with light winds. By the day after, expect 6 ft @ 9s, but with a fresh 12 mph W wind, making it a bit choppy. Best: today.
