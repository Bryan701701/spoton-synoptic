Today in Caithness, surf is looking solid at 6 ft @ 14s W with a fresh 17 mph SE wind. Sheltered spots like Point of Ness and Murkle Point are your best bets, especially between 08:45 and 13:58. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @ 8s ESE with a strong 38 mph SE wind, making it poor across the board. The day after, we see a slight improvement with 4 ft @ 8s E and lighter winds, but still not ideal. Best: today.
