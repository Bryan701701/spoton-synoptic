Today in North Devon, there's small surf at 1ft @4s with a fresh 12 mph NW wind. Woolacombe and Putsborough are your best bets, with sheltered corners working well. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4ft @6s but the fresh NW wind will make it blown out across the region. Day after looks promising with 2ft @6s and light 6 mph W winds, making for clean and fun surf. Best: day after.
