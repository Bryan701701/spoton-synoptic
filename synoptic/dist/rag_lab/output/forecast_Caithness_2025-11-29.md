Today in Caithness, it’s looking solid with 8 ft @10s NNW swell and fresh 14 mph NNW winds. Good spots like Point of Ness and Murkle Point are working well, especially on the mid-tide push. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 6 ft @9s N with lighter 12 mph NNE winds, making for clean conditions at spots like Thurso East and Sandside Bay. Day after, conditions deteriorate with 3 ft @10s N swell and fresh 23 mph SSE winds, leading to blown-out surf. Best: today.
