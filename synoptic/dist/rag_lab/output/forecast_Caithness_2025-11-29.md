Today in Caithness, it's looking solid with 8 ft @10s NNW swell and fresh 14 mph NNW winds. Good spots like Point of Ness and Murkle Point are working well, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions ease slightly with 6 ft @9s N swell and moderate 12 mph NNE winds, still offering fun waves at places like Thurso East. Day after, expect a drop to 3 ft @10s with fresh 23 mph SSE winds, making it less inviting. Best: today.
