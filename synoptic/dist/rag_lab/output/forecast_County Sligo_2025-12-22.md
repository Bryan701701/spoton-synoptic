County Sligo is looking solid over the next three days! Today, expect fun 4 ft @ 12s WNW at Strandhill and Easkey spots, with light NE winds keeping it clean. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 11s, still workable at Strandhill, but others may be quiet. Day after, we bounce back to 4 ft @ 12s NW with light NNW winds, making for a great session at Strandhill and Easkey. Best: today.
