Today in North Yorks, it's looking pretty flat with 1 ft @ 4s SSE across all spots and fresh 21 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell remains at 1 ft but shifts to 5s E, with slightly lighter 17 mph WNW winds, still not producing anything worthwhile. Day after, the swell drops further to 1 ft @ 3s S with 10 mph SSW winds, keeping it quiet. Best: none.
