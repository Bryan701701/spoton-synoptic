Today across North Yorks, it's looking pretty quiet with 1 ft @ 4s SSE swell and fresh 21 mph SSW winds. Tomorrow, the swell remains at 1 ft @ 5s E, with slightly lighter 17 mph WNW winds, but still not much happening. Day after, conditions are similar with 1 ft @ 3s S and 10 mph SSW winds. Best: tomorrow.
