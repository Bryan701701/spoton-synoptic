Today in County Clare, conditions are poor with 5 ft @17s W swell and fresh 21 mph SSE winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 7 ft @14s W but the wind ramps up to a strong 30 mph WSW, keeping it messy and unworkable. By the day after, conditions improve slightly with 6 ft @11s W swell and lighter 14 mph S winds, offering some potential at spots like Doolin Point and Lahinch Beach during the tide windows. Best: day after.
