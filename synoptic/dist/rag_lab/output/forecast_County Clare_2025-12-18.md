Today in County Clare, it's a bit rough with 5 ft @17s W swell and fresh 21 mph SSE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with 7 ft @14s W swell and strong 30 mph WSW winds, keeping it messy. The day after brings a slight improvement at 6 ft @11s W with lighter 14 mph S winds, offering some workable windows at spots like Crab Island and Doolin Point. Best: day after.
