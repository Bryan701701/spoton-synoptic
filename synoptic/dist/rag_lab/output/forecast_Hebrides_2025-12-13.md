Today in the Hebrides, it's a challenging surf day with 12 ft @12s WSW swell but fresh 35 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a drop to 9 ft @12s WSW with 25 mph SSW winds, still not ideal. The day after holds similar conditions with 9 ft @12s WSW and 26 mph SSW winds, keeping it messy. Best: none.
