Today on the East Coast, it's looking fun with 2 ft @ 7s SE swell and light 4 mph SSW winds. Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay are your top picks, especially from 08:31 to 14:33. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 2 ft @ 5s S swell and fresh 10 mph SW winds, making it a poor day for surf. By the day after, we see a slight improvement with 3 ft @ 6s SSE swell at spots like Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay, with light winds. Best: today.
