Today on the East Coast, it's looking fun with clean 2 ft @7s SE swell and light 4 mph SSW winds. Spots like Coldinham Bay and Pease Bay are prime for a session, especially on the mid-tide push. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 2 ft @5s S swell and fresh 10 mph SW winds, making it less appealing. Day after, we see a slight improvement with 3 ft @6s SSE swell, but still a bit choppy. Best: today.
