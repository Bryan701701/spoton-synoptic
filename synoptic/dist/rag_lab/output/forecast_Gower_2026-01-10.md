Gower is looking solid today with 5 ft @10s WSW swell and light NNW winds at 13 mph. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are both clean and working well throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @6s SW with fresh SSE winds, making it a poor choice. The day after, swell increases to 8 ft @9s WSW but remains blown out with strong SSW winds. Best: today.
