Sutherland is lighting up today with Sango Bay offering 5 ft @9s NNW and a fresh 22 mph W wind. It’s clean early and should hold shape through the mid-tide push. Tomorrow, conditions drop with a hefty 13 ft swell but strong 28 mph NNW winds will make it blown out everywhere. The day after stays rough with 12 ft @10s N and 40 mph winds, keeping it poor across the board. Best: today.
