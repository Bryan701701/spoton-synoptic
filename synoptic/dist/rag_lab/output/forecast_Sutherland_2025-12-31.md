Sutherland is looking solid today with Sango Bay lighting up at 5 ft @9s NNW and a fresh 22 mph W wind. Best conditions are on the mid-tide push from 09:09 to 15:34. Tomorrow, the swell ramps up to 13 ft @11s, but with a strong 28 mph NNW wind, it’ll be blown out across the board. Day after, still hefty at 12 ft @10s, but the 40 mph N wind keeps it messy. Best: today.
