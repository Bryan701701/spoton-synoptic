Today on the West Coast, conditions are poor with a swell at 5 ft @14s WNW, but fresh 23 mph SSW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell increases to 9 ft @14s WNW, but the wind picks up even more to 27 mph SSW, keeping it messy. On the day after, the swell drops back to 5 ft @10s WNW with winds easing to 20 mph SSW, but still not producing quality surf. Best: day after.
