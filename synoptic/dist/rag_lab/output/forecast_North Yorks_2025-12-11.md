Today in North Yorks, it’s a quiet scene with 1 ft @ 4s SW swell and fresh 22 mph WSW winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 2 ft @ 7s ESE swell and moderate 17 mph S winds, offering some workable conditions at spots like Withernsea and Filey during the mid-tide windows. The day after, conditions remain similar, but the swell angle shifts to NNW, still at 2 ft @ 7s, with light winds, keeping it on the poor side. Best: tomorrow.
