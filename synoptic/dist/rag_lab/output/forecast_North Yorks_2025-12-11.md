Today is flat across North Yorks with no surf energy—just 1 ft @4s SW and fresh 22 mph WSW winds. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 2 ft @7s ESE and moderate 17 mph S winds, but still not producing much. The day after continues the trend with similar conditions, 2 ft @7s NNW, but remains poor overall. Best: tomorrow.
