Today on the West Coast, it's a bit rough with fresh NNW winds at 31 mph creating blown-out conditions, despite an 8 ft @ 8s NW swell. Tomorrow sees a drop to 3 ft @ 9s WNW with lighter 16 mph SW winds, making it more workable at spots like Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay. Day after, conditions improve further with a fun 4 ft @ 10s WNW swell and light 10 mph WNW winds, perfect for getting out there. Best: day after.
