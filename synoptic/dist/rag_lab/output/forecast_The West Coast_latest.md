Today, the West Coast is facing a challenging surf day with 7 ft @12s W swell but fresh 34 mph ESE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 5 ft @12s W, still with fresh 26 mph ENE winds, keeping conditions poor. By the day after, conditions improve a bit with 3 ft @10s W swell and lighter 15 mph ESE winds, offering some workable options at spots like Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay. Best: day after.
