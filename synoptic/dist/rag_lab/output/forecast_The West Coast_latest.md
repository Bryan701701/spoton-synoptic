Today on the West Coast, it's a no-go with 5 ft @9s W swell and fresh 38 mph S winds creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 6 ft @15s WNW swell, but the 21 mph S winds will still keep things messy. By the day after, the swell picks up to 9 ft @14s W, but with 27 mph SSW winds, it remains challenging. Best: tomorrow.
