Today on the West Coast, conditions are poor with 3 ft @11s W swell and fresh 19 mph SSW winds causing a blown-out surf. Tomorrow looks much better as the swell builds to 4 ft @11s with lighter 10 mph SSW winds, making for clean conditions at spots like Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay. The day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @8s but with fresh 25 mph SSW winds, leading to messy surf. Best: tomorrow.
