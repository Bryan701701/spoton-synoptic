Today on the West Coast, it’s blown out with fresh 24 mph SSW winds and a hefty 7 ft @12s W swell. Tomorrow sees similar conditions, with winds increasing to 29 mph, keeping it messy. By the day after, the swell drops to 4 ft @9s WSW, but the fresh 32 mph ESE wind will still make it challenging. Best: today.
