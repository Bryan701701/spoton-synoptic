Today on the West Coast, it's looking fun with 2 ft @8s NW swell and fresh 17 mph E winds. Balephetrish and Balevullin Bay are your best bets, especially from 09:03 to 15:55. Tomorrow, conditions drop to flat with no surf data available. By the day after, Dunaverty shows some promise with 2 ft @6s NE, but the wind remains fresh at 14 mph E. Best: today.
