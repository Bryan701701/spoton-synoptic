The West Coast is looking good today with 2 ft @10s WNW swell and light 10 mph E winds. Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay are your best bets, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @12s WNW but with fresh 19 mph E winds, making it blown out across the board. Day after, expect 3 ft @10s NW with moderate 13 mph E winds; still workable at sheltered spots like Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay. Best: today.
