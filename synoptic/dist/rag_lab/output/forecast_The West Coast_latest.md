Today on the West Coast, it's looking fun with 3 ft @ 9s WNW swell and light 6 mph NW winds. Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay are your top picks, both working well throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 4 ft @ 9s with a moderate 11 mph SW wind, keeping things lively at the same spots. Day after, expect a hefty 7 ft @ 13s, but the fresh 26 mph SSW wind will make it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
