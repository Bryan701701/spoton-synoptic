Today on the West Coast, conditions are poor with a swell of 3 ft @ 11s from the W and fresh 19 mph SSW winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow looks much better, with a solid 4 ft @ 11s swell and lighter 10 mph SSW winds, providing clean options at spots like Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay. Day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @ 8s, but winds pick up to 25 mph SSW, resulting in messy conditions. Best: tomorrow.
