Today on the West Coast, conditions are poor with a hefty 9 ft @10s W swell, but fresh 34 mph SW winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 6 ft @11s W, still with fresh 35 mph SSW winds, keeping it messy. By the day after, the swell continues to decline to 5 ft @14s WNW, with winds easing to 24 mph S, but it remains poor overall. Best: day after.
