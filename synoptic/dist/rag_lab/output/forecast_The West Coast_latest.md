Today on the West Coast, conditions are poor with 6 ft @7s NNW swell and fresh 28 mph N wind creating a blown-out situation. Tomorrow looks similar with the same swell and wind conditions. By the day after, the swell drops to 3 ft @6s NW, but the fresh NNW wind continues to keep it choppy. Best: none.
