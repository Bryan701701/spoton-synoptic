Today on the West Coast, it's looking solid with 4 ft @6s NW and fresh 18 mph NNW wind. Balephetrish and Balevullin Bay are clean and working well, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with fresh 26 mph N winds making it blown out and poor across the board. Day after, things improve slightly with 4 ft @6s WNW, but still a bit choppy at spots like Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay. Best: today.
