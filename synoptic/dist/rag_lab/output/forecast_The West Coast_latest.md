Today, the West Coast is seeing 2 ft @12s WNW with light 4 mph NNE winds, but conditions are poor across the board. Tomorrow, expect similar 2 ft @7s ENE, with fresh 14 mph E winds making it a bit choppy; Dunaverty might be the best bet. On the day after, surf drops to 1 ft @8s WNW with stronger 20 mph W winds, leading to blown-out conditions. Best: tomorrow.
