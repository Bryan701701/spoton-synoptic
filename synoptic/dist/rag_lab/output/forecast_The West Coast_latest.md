Today on the West Coast, conditions are poor with a hefty 9 ft @12s W swell and fresh 27 mph SW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a drop to 5 ft @11s WNW, but the 18 mph SSE winds will still keep it choppy and messy. The day after, the swell remains at 5 ft @14s WNW with stronger 32 mph ESE winds, continuing the poor conditions. Best: tomorrow.
