Today in North Yorks, it's clean and fun with 1 ft @10s N swell and light 10 mph SW winds. Withernsea, Filey, and Whitby Beach are all working well, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 4 ft @7s N with fresh 28 mph WNW winds, making it blown out across the coast. The day after sees 3 ft @8s NNE swell with 20 mph SSW winds, still not ideal. Best: today.
