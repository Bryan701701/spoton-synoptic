Today in South Devon, it's looking poor with 3 ft @5s E swell and fresh 13 mph NE winds. Tomorrow, conditions worsen slightly with the same swell size but a stronger 26 mph ENE wind, making it blown out. By the day after, the swell drops to 2 ft @6s ESE, with lighter 12 mph NE winds, but still not producing much. Best: today.
