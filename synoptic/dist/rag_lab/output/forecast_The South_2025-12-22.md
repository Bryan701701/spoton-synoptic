Today, the South is quiet with a weak 2 ft @6s SE swell and light N winds, not producing much. Tomorrow brings a slight bump to 3 ft @6s SE, but fresh 15 mph NE winds will keep it blown out. Day after, the swell drops back to 2 ft @5s E with moderate NNE winds, still not offering much. Best: tomorrow.
