Today in Gower, surf is looking solid with 6 ft @12s WSW swell and a fresh 15 mph SW wind. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are your best bets, both working well throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 7 ft @8s WSW with a strong 22 mph SSW wind, making it poor across the board. Day after continues the trend with 7 ft @9s WSW and 19 mph SSE winds, still not ideal. Best: today.
