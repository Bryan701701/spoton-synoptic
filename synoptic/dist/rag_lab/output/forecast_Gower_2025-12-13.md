Today on Gower, it's looking good with 6 ft @12s WSW swell and a fresh 15 mph SW wind. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are your best bets, both working well from 08:15 to 16:07. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 7 ft @8s WSW swell and a strong 22 mph SSW wind, making it poor across the board. Day after, similar 7 ft @9s WSW swell continues with 19 mph SSE winds, still not ideal. Best: today.
