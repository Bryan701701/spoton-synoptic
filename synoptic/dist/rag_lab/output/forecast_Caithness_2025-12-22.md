Today in Caithness, conditions are poor with 3 ft @ 6s ESE swell and fresh 19 mph ESE winds. Tomorrow sees a slight improvement with 2 ft @ 10s WNW at Dunnet Bay, but the wind remains moderate at 14 mph S, making it a bit choppy. The day after looks promising, with 5 ft @ 13s WNW swell and light 2 mph WSW winds, creating clean conditions at spots like Point of Ness and Sandside Bay. Best: day after.
