Today in Caithness, conditions are poor with 4 ft @ 11s W swell but fresh 22 mph ESE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, expect a slight drop to 2 ft @ 10s WNW with moderate 14 mph S winds; still not ideal but a bit more manageable at Dunnet Bay. Day after brings a solid improvement with 5 ft @ 13s WNW and light 2 mph WSW winds, creating clean conditions at spots like Point of Ness and Sandside Bay. Best: day after.
