Today in Caithness, conditions are poor with 3 ft @ 6s ESE swell and fresh 19 mph ESE winds. Tomorrow, things improve slightly with 2 ft @ 10s WNW at Dunnet Bay, but still a bit choppy with 14 mph S winds. The day after looks promising with 5 ft @ 13s WNW swell and light 2 mph WSW winds at several spots like Point of Ness and Sandside Bay. Best: day after.
