Today, the Causeway Coast is seeing 3 ft @ 11s WNW swell, but fresh 22 mph SSW winds are making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with the same swell height but dropping to 9s, and winds picking up to 26 mph S, keeping it messy. By the day after, we’ll have similar 3 ft @ 9s WNW swell with easing winds at 17 mph SSE, offering a bit of improvement, especially at White Park Bay and Portballintrae during the mid-tide window. Best: day after.
