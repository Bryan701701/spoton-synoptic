Today, the Causeway Coast is facing fresh onshore winds at 22 mph, with 3 ft @ 11s WNW swell, making it blown out and not producing. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with similar swell but increased wind at 26 mph from the south, keeping it messy. By the day after, the wind eases to 17 mph SSE, and while White Park Bay and Portballintrae show some potential, overall conditions remain poor. Best: day after.
