Today, the Causeway Coast is seeing 3 ft @ 11s WNW swell but with fresh 22 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions worsen slightly with the same swell size but a stronger 26 mph S wind, keeping it messy. On the day after, the swell remains at 3 ft @ 9s WNW, with winds easing to 17 mph SSE, offering some workable options at spots like White Park Bay and Portballintrae during the mid-tide window. Best: day after.
