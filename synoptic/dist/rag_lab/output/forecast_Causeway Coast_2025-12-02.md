Today, the Causeway Coast is experiencing fresh SSW winds at 22 mph, creating blown-out conditions with 3 ft @11s WNW swell. Tomorrow, winds pick up to 26 mph from the S, keeping the surf messy and unworkable at the same size. By the day after, conditions improve slightly with 3 ft @9s WNW swell and lighter SSE winds at 17 mph, but still only a couple of spots like White Park Bay and Portballintrae showing some potential. Best: day after.
