Today in County Sligo, it's looking great with 4 ft @12s NW swell and light 4 mph ESE winds. Strandhill and Easkey spots are clean and fun, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @11s with fresh 14 mph ESE winds, making it a bit choppy, but Strandhill still offers some rideable waves. The day after, conditions decline further to 2 ft @10s, with light NE winds, so it might be a quiet day. Best: today.
