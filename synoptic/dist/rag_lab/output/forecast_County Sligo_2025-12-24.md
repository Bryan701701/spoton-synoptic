County Sligo is lighting up today with fun 4 ft @ 12s NW swell and light ESE winds, making for clean conditions at Strandhill and Easkey spots. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 11s with fresh ESE winds, so expect it to be a bit choppy, but Strandhill still has some potential. The day after, conditions go flat with 2 ft @ 10s, so it’s best to give it a miss. Best: today.
