Today in County Sligo, it's looking great with 4 ft @ 12s NW swell and light 4 mph ESE winds. Strandhill and Easkey spots are firing, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 11s with fresh 14 mph ESE winds, making it a bit choppy but still surfable at Strandhill. Day after, conditions decline further with 2 ft @ 10s and light NE winds, so it’s best to give it a miss. Best: today.
