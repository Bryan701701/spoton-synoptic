North Devon is looking solid today with 5 ft @ 13s W swell and moderate 14 mph NW winds. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are great picks, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, expect a slight drop to 4 ft @ 13s W, but still fun at spots like Woolacombe and Putsborough. Day after, conditions remain similar at 4 ft, but the period shortens to 9s, making it a bit peaky. Best: today.
