North Devon is looking solid today with 5 ft @ 13s W swell and moderate NW winds at 14 mph. Porlock Weir and Lynmouth are great picks, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 4 ft @ 13s W, still offering fun conditions at spots like Woolacombe and Putsborough. Day after, expect similar 4 ft @ 9s WSW, with a bit of a shift in conditions but still workable at sheltered corners. Best: today.
