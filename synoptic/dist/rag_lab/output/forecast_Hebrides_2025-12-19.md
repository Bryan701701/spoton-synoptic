Today, the Hebrides are facing fresh 30 mph SW winds with 9 ft @12s WSW swell, making it blown out and messy across the board. Tomorrow, conditions remain poor with 7 ft @10s WSW swell and 24 mph SSE winds, still not workable. On the day after, the swell drops slightly to 8 ft @13s WSW with 21 mph ESE winds, but it's still not producing well. Best: none.
