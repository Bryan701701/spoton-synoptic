Today in the Hebrides, conditions are challenging with 9 ft @12s WSW swell and fresh 30 mph SW winds creating a blown-out scene. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 7 ft @10s but remains messy with 24 mph SSE winds. On the day after, expect 8 ft @13s WSW with 21 mph ESE winds, still not ideal. Best: day after.
