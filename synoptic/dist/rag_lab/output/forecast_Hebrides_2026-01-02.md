Today in the Hebrides, it's a tough call with 12 ft @10s N swell but fresh 38 mph N winds making it blown out across all spots. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 8 ft @9s, but the same strong winds persist, keeping conditions poor. By the day after, the swell eases to 7 ft @9s with winds calming to 25 mph, still not ideal but a bit more manageable. Best: day after.
