Today in the Hebrides, conditions are tough with a hefty 12 ft @10s N swell and fresh 38 mph N winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a drop to 8 ft @9s, but the wind remains strong at 37 mph N, keeping it messy. By the day after, the swell continues to fade to 7 ft @9s with slightly lighter winds at 25 mph N, but still not ideal. Best: day after.
