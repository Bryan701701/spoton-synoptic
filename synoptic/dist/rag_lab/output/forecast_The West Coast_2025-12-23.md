Today on the West Coast, it's looking good with 2 ft @10s WNW swell and light E winds at 10 mph. Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay are your best bets, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 4 ft @12s WNW swell but fresh E winds at 19 mph will make it blown out. By the day after, things improve slightly to 3 ft @10s NW, still with E winds at 13 mph, making for workable conditions at sheltered spots like Ardnave Bay. Best: today.
