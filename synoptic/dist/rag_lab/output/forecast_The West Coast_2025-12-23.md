Today on the West Coast, it's looking good with 2 ft @10s WNW swell and light 10 mph E winds. Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay are your best bets, with clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop as the swell increases to 4 ft @12s WNW but fresh 19 mph E winds will make it blown out. Day after, the swell eases to 3 ft @10s NW with similar winds, still offering some fun at sheltered spots like Ardnave Bay. Best: today.
