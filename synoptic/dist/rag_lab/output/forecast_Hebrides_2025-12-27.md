Today in the Hebrides, it's looking fun with 3 ft @ 9s W swell and a light 11 mph ENE wind. Good spots like Europie and Dalbeg are working well, especially during the mid-morning and early afternoon tides. Tomorrow, the swell shifts slightly to 3 ft @ 11s WNW with light 5 mph E winds, making for clean conditions at spots like Dalmore and Cliff. Day after, expect a bump to 4 ft @ 11s NW, with light 2 mph S winds, keeping it nice and clean across the region. Best: day after.
