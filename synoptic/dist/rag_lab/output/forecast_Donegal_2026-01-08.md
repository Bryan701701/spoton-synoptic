Today in Donegal, we have clean surf at 4ft @9s WNW with light 9 mph WNW winds. Good spots like Rossnowlagh and Tullan Strand are working well, especially on the push. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 5ft @10s with light winds, making it a great day at places like Magheroaty Beach and Bloody Foreland. Day after, expect a solid 8ft @11s with light ESE winds, perfect for those looking for some bigger waves at spots like Mageroaty. Best: day after.
