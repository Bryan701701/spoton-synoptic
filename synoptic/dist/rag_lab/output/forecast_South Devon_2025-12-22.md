Today in South Devon, it's looking poor with 3 ft @6s SSE swell and fresh 24 mph SE winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 2 ft @5s with 25 mph ESE winds, still not producing any quality surf. By the day after, conditions remain similar with 3 ft @5s E swell and 16 mph ENE winds, but still not ideal. Best: day after.
