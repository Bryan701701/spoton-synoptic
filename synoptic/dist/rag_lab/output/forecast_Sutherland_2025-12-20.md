Sutherland is lighting up today with solid 6 ft @10s W swell and light S winds at 10 mph. Melvich and Strathy are both great picks, with Strathy best around 09:05–15:22. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @15s WNW, but the E winds at 11 mph will keep it clean, especially in the morning. On the day after, expect 5 ft @12s W with similar E winds, making for another fun day. Best: today.
