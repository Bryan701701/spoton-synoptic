Today, the South is quiet with a 4 ft @8s swell from the S, but fresh 20 mph onshore winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with a 7 ft @9s swell from the SW and moderate 16 mph W winds, offering some workable options at spots like Ballinskelligs Bay and Derrynane. Day after, the swell drops to 5 ft @8s, but fresh 39 mph S winds will keep it messy and uninviting. Best: tomorrow.
