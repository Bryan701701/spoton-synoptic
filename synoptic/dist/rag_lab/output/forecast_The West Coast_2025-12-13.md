Today on the West Coast, conditions are poor with a hefty 8 ft @ 13s W swell, but fresh 26 mph SSW winds are blowing it out. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 5 ft @ 10s W, still messy with 25 mph S winds. Day after brings a better outlook with 6 ft @ 12s W and lighter 12 mph SW winds, making for cleaner surf at spots like Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay. Best: day after.
