Today on the West Coast, it's looking poor with 8 ft @ 13s W and fresh 26 mph SSW winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions remain similar with 5 ft @ 10s W and 25 mph S winds, still not producing. However, the day after brings a nice change with 6 ft @ 12s W, light 12 mph SW winds, and some good options at spots like Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay. Best: day after.
