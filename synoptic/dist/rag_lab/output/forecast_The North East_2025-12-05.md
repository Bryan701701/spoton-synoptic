Today, the North East is looking fun with 2 ft @ 6s E swell and light 6 mph SW winds. Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands are your go-to spots, both offering clean conditions from 08:09 to 15:40. Tomorrow, the swell bumps up to 3 ft @ 6s ESE but with fresh 18 mph S winds, making it blown out and poor across the board. Day after drops back to 1 ft @ 6s E, still messy with 7 mph SW winds. Best: today.
