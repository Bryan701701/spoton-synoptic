Today, the North East is looking fun with clean 2 ft @6s E swell and light 6 mph SW winds. Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands are great picks, both working well throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @6s ESE but with fresh 18 mph S winds, making it blown out. Day after, the swell fades to 1 ft @6s E with similar winds, so it’s best to skip it. Best: today.
