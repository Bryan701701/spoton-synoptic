Today, the North East is lighting up with clean 2 ft @6s E swell and light 6 mph SW winds. Great options include Saltburn Beach and Coatham Sands, both offering fun waves throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop to 3 ft @6s E with fresh 18 mph S winds, making it poor across the board. Day after, we see a further decline to 1 ft @6s E, still with light 7 mph SW winds, so it’s best to give it a miss. Best: today.
