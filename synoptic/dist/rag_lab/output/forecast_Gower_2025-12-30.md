Today in Gower, it's looking poor with 2 ft @9s SSW swell, but fresh 23 mph ENE winds are making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, conditions improve slightly with 1 ft @12s WSW swell and light 6 mph ESE winds, offering some clean options at Llangennith Beach and Oxwich Bay during the mid-day push. The day after returns to poor conditions with 2 ft @5s W swell and fresh 18 mph WNW winds, keeping things choppy. Best: tomorrow.
