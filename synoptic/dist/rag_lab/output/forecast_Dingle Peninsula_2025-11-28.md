Today on the Dingle Peninsula, conditions are poor with a hefty 15 ft @ 13s W swell and fresh 34 mph W winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 9 ft @ 10s W, but the fresh 22 mph NNE wind keeps it messy and not producing. By the day after, things improve slightly to 6 ft @ 9s WNW with a lighter 15 mph W wind, offering some workable options at spots like Ballybunion. Best: day after.
