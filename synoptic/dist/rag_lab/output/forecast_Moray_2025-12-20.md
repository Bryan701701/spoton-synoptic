Today in Moray, it's a quiet scene with 1 ft @7s WNW across the board and a fresh 7 mph SSE wind. Tomorrow, conditions remain poor with 1 ft @4s ESE and a stronger 23 mph ESE wind, making it blown out. On the day after, there's a slight improvement with 3 ft @6s E, but still only Fraserburgh showing some potential. Best: day after.
