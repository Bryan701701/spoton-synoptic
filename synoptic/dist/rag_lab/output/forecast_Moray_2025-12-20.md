Today in Moray, it's a quiet scene with 1 ft @7s WNW across the spots, and light 7 mph SSE winds. Tomorrow stays similar with 1 ft @4s ESE, but fresh 23 mph ESE winds will make it blown out. Day after brings a slight improvement with 3 ft @6s E and 14 mph ESE winds; Fraserburgh is the standout. Best: day after.
