Today, Cornwall is lighting up with clean surf! North spots like Crantock and Fistral are offering 5ft @9s WNW with a fresh 16 mph NW wind, best early and mid-tide. South coast is looking solid too, with Porthcurno and Praa Sands holding 4ft @9s W, light winds making for fun conditions. Tomorrow, expect a drop in quality as winds pick up and swell shifts, leading to blown-out conditions across the board. Day after, things improve with cleaner lines returning, especially at North spots. Best: today.
