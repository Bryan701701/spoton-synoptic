Today, Cornwall is lighting up with solid surf! North spots like Crantock and Fistral are offering 5ft @9s WNW, with a fresh 16 mph NW wind, best early and mid. The South is looking good too, with Porthcurno and Praa Sands serving up fun 4ft @9s W waves and light winds. Over on the West, Sennen Cove and Gwenvor are also in the mix with similar conditions. Tomorrow, expect a drop in quality as winds ramp up and conditions go poor. Day after, the North picks up again with 7ft @10s, but winds may still be tricky. Best: today!
