Today, the North coast is looking solid with 5 ft @9s WNW swell and 16 mph NW winds. Crantock and Fistral are your best bets, especially early on the push. Tomorrow, conditions take a hit with fresh onshore winds and poor surf across all coasts. By the day after, the North picks up to 7 ft @10s with light S winds, making it a great day for Crantock and Fistral again. Best: today.
