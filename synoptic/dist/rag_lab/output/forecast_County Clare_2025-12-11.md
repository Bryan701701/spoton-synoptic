Today in County Clare, conditions are poor with a fresh 27 mph S wind on 4 ft @9s WSW swell, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees an increase in swell to 10 ft @16s, but the same fresh S wind will keep it messy. By the day after, conditions improve slightly with 8 ft @13s W and lighter 14 mph SSW winds, offering a better chance at workable waves. Best: day after.
