Today in County Clare, it’s a bit rough with 4 ft @9s WSW swell and fresh 27 mph S winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow, the swell jumps to 10 ft @16s W, but the wind remains strong at 20 mph S, keeping conditions poor. By the day after, things improve slightly with 8 ft @13s W swell and lighter 14 mph SSW winds, offering some workable options at spots like Doolin Point and Lahinch. Best: day after.
