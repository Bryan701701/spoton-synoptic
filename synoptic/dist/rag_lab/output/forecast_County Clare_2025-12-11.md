Today in County Clare, it's a bit of a struggle with 4 ft @9s WSW swell but fresh 27 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 10 ft @16s W, but the wind remains strong at 20 mph S, keeping conditions poor. By the day after, the swell drops to 8 ft @13s W with lighter 14 mph SSW winds, offering some workable options at spots like Doolin Point and Lahinch Beach during the tide windows. Best: day after.
