Today in County Sligo, it's looking solid with 7 ft @14s WNW swell and fresh 16 mph SSE winds. Strandhill and Easkey Right are your best bets, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow drops to 3 ft @11s WNW with similar winds, making it less exciting but still surfable at Strandhill. The day after, expect 3 ft @9s WNW, with light winds, offering a fun session at Strandhill and Easkey Left. Best: today.
