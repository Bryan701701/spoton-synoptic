Today in County Sligo, we're seeing some solid action with 7 ft @ 14s WNW swell and fresh 16 mph SSE winds. Strandhill and Easkey spots are working well, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 11s, but Strandhill still has potential. By the day after, conditions improve slightly with 3 ft @ 9s and lighter winds, making for a fun session at Strandhill and Easkey Left. Best: today.
