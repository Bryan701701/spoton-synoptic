Today in County Sligo, surf is on with 7 ft @ 14s WNW and fresh 16 mph SSE winds. Strandhill and Easkey Right are your best bets, with good windows throughout the day. Tomorrow sees a drop to 3 ft @ 11s WNW, still workable at Strandhill but overall less exciting. By the day after, conditions improve slightly to 3 ft @ 9s WNW, with light winds making it a fun option at Strandhill and Easkey Left. Best: today.
