Today in County Sligo, it's looking solid with 7 ft @ 14s WNW swell and fresh 16 mph SSE winds. Strandhill and Easkey Right are your best bets, especially during their optimal tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 11s, still workable at Strandhill but overall conditions are less favorable. By the day after, expect similar 3 ft @ 9s with lighter winds, making it a bit cleaner. Best: today.
