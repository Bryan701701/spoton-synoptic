Today on the West Coast, it's looking solid with 7 ft @ 14s WNW swell and light 12 mph S winds. Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay are the top picks, both offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 10s WSW with fresh 15 mph S winds, still workable but less powerful. The day after, conditions worsen with 4 ft @ 10s W swell and stronger 20 mph SSW winds, making it less inviting. Best: today.
