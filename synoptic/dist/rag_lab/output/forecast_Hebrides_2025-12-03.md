Today, the Hebrides are experiencing strong conditions with 8 ft @10s SW swell and fresh 35 mph SSE winds, making it blown out across the board. Tomorrow sees a slight drop to 5 ft @9s SW, but the fresh 23 mph ESE winds will keep it messy. By the day after, the swell picks back up to 8 ft @13s W, though the 25 mph SSE winds will still create challenging conditions. Best: day after.
