Today in Sutherland, it's looking great with 4 ft @ 12s WNW swell and light ESE winds at 4 mph. Melvich and Strathy are both firing, especially during their prime tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 3 ft @ 11s WNW with SE winds at 6 mph, still offering fun conditions at spots like Armadale Bay and Sango Bay. By the day after, the swell continues to hold at 3 ft but with fresh NNE winds at 21 mph, making it a bit challenging—Oldshoremore is your best bet. Best: today.
