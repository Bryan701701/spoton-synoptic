Sutherland is lighting up today with 4 ft @12s WNW swell and light ESE winds, making for clean conditions at spots like Melvich and Strathy. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 3 ft @11s, but remains fun with SE winds; check out Melvich and Sango Bay during their best tide windows. By the day after, conditions shift with 3 ft @7s NW swell and fresh NNE winds, making it a bit challenging, but Oldshoremore could still offer some fun. Best: today.
