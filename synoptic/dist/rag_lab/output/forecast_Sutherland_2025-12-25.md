Today in Sutherland, it's looking great with clean 4 ft @ 12s WNW swell and light 4 mph ESE winds. Good options include Melvich and Strathy, both offering fun conditions during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops slightly to 3 ft @ 11s with a gentle 6 mph SE breeze, still providing workable waves at spots like Melvich and Sango Bay. On the day after, the surf will be 3 ft @ 7s but with fresh 21 mph NNE winds, making it challenging except for Oldshoremore. Best: today.
