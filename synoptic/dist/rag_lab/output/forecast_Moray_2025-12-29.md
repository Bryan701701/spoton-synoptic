Today in Moray, it's a fun day with 2 ft @ 8s NNE swell and light W winds at 11 mph. Good spots like Fraserburgh and Pennan are working well, especially during their respective tide windows. Tomorrow, expect a solid bump to 4 ft @ 10s NNE with moderate N winds, keeping conditions clean across the board. Day after, conditions drop to 3 ft @ 8s but with fresh W winds, making it blown out and less appealing. Best: tomorrow.
