Today in Moray, it’s a fun 2 ft @ 8s NNE with a moderate 11 mph W wind. Fraserburgh and Pennan are your best bets, both offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 4 ft @ 10s NNE with a light 12 mph N wind, making for solid surf at multiple spots like Lossiemouth and Banff. Day after, winds ramp up to 28 mph W, creating blown-out conditions across the board, so it’s best to skip it. Best: tomorrow.
