Today on the East Coast, it's looking fun with 4 ft @6s S swell and fresh 16 mph SSW winds. Aberdeen Beach and Cruden Bay are your best bets, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow drops to 2 ft @4s S with light 4 mph SSW winds, so it’s not producing much. Day after brings a slight improvement with 3 ft @5s SE and light 7 mph SE winds, making it a good day at the beaches. Best: today.
