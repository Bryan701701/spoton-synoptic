Today on the Dingle Peninsula, it's looking solid with 6 ft @9s WNW swell and a light 11 mph W wind. Ballybunion Right and Ballybunion Beach are your best bets, especially from 09:25 to 17:28. Tomorrow, the swell builds to 7 ft @9s WSW with a gentle 6 mph SSE wind, making for clean conditions at the same spots. Day after, the swell jumps to 12 ft @13s W but with fresh 17 mph SW wind, leading to blown-out conditions. Best: tomorrow.
