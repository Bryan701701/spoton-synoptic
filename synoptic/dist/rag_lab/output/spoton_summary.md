Today on the West Coast, it's a bit of a struggle with 5 ft @11s WNW swell but fresh 23 mph E winds making it blown out. Tomorrow sees a drop to 2 ft @10s, still with fresh ENE winds, so not much to work with. Day after brings a better outlook with 5 ft @13s WNW swell and lighter 13 mph E winds, making it more workable at spots like Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay. Best: day after.
