Today on the West Coast, surf is flat with no swell energy, so it’s a quiet day. Tomorrow sees a slight bump to 2 ft @10s, but fresh ENE wind will keep it messy. The day after brings better conditions with 5 ft @13s, particularly at spots like Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay, where the wind is lighter. Best: day after.
