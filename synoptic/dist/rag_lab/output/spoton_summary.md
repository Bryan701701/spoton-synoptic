Today on the West Coast, it's a fun 3 ft @9s WNW with light 6 mph NW winds. Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay are looking clean and workable, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, expect a bit more punch with swell increasing to 4 ft @9s, still holding shape under 11 mph SW winds. The day after, conditions will be challenging with 7 ft @13s but fresh 26 mph SSW winds will make it blown out. Best: tomorrow.
