Today on the West Coast, it's a no-go with 5 ft @9s W swell but fresh 38 mph S winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions remain poor with 6 ft @15s WNW swell and 21 mph S winds, still not producing. The day after sees an increase to 9 ft @14s W swell, but with 27 mph SSW winds, it remains messy. Best: none.
