Today on the West Coast, we’ve got fun 3 ft @ 9s WNW swell with light 6 mph NW winds. Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay are your best bets, offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow sees the swell bump up to 4 ft @ 9s with moderate 11 mph SW winds, keeping it lively at the same spots. The day after, expect 7 ft @ 13s but with fresh 26 mph SSW winds, making it blown out across the board. Best: tomorrow.
