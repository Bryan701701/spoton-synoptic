Today on the West Coast, it's a solid 4 ft @ 11s WNW with light 5 mph NNW winds, making for clean conditions. Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay are the top picks, both offering great windows throughout the day. Tomorrow, expect the swell to build to 6 ft @ 12s WNW with moderate 13 mph S winds; it’ll still be workable, but a bit choppy. The day after, conditions drop to 4 ft @ 6s SSW with fresh 32 mph SSE winds, likely making it blown out. Best: today.
