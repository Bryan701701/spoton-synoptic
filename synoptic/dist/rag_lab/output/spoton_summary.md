Today on the West Coast, conditions are poor with 4 ft @11s WNW swell, but fresh 21 mph SSE winds are making it blown out. Tomorrow, the swell picks up to 7 ft @12s WSW, yet the fresh 30 mph ESE winds will keep it messy. By the day after, conditions improve slightly with 5 ft @12s W swell and lighter 15 mph ENE winds, making some sheltered spots like Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay workable. Best: day after.
