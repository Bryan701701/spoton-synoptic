Today on the West Coast, it's looking solid with 4 ft @ 9s W and a fresh 13 mph SW wind. Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay are your go-to spots, both working well throughout the day. Tomorrow, conditions drop with 5 ft @ 13s WNW but fresh 25 mph SSW winds will make it blown out. The day after, similar conditions persist with 6 ft @ 13s W, still messy with 20 mph S winds. Best: today.
