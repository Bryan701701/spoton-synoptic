Today on the West Coast, it's looking solid with 4 ft @ 6s NW swell and fresh 18 mph NNW winds. Balephetrish and Balevullin Bay are great picks, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, conditions drop as the wind picks up to 26 mph N, making it blown out and poor across the board. On the day after, we see a slight improvement with 4 ft @ 6s WNW swell, but still fresh winds at 14 mph. Best: today.
