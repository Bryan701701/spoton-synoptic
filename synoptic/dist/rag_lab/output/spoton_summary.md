Today on the West Coast, it's a bit rough with 7 ft @12s W swell and fresh 24 mph SSW winds making it blown out. Tomorrow, conditions worsen with similar swell but stronger 29 mph SSW winds, keeping it messy. By the day after, the swell drops to 4 ft @9s WSW, but the fresh 32 mph ESE wind will still make it challenging. Best: today.
