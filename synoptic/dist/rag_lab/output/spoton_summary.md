Today on the West Coast, it's looking solid with 6 ft @10s W swell and light 12 mph SSW winds. Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay are both clean and working well, especially during their tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 5 ft @11s WNW with fresh 17 mph SW winds, making it a bit choppy but still surfable at sheltered spots. Day after, swell picks up to 7 ft @13s WNW, but the wind remains fresh, keeping it a bit messy. Best: today.
