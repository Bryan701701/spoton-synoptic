Today on the West Coast, it's a bit rough with 4 ft @7s SE swell and fresh 39 mph ESE winds, making it blown out. Tomorrow sees an increase to 8 ft @10s W, but the 29 mph SW winds will keep it messy. The day after, conditions remain similar with 6 ft @11s W and 29 mph S winds, still not ideal. Best: tomorrow.
