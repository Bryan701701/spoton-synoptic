Today on the West Coast, surf is a fun 3 ft @5s WNW with fresh 14 mph WSW winds. Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay are your best bets, offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, swell picks up to 6 ft @7s NW with moderate 17 mph NW winds, making for a solid day at spots like Balephetrish and Balevullin Bay. Day after, swell eases to 4 ft @8s WNW, still workable at sheltered corners like Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay. Best: tomorrow.
