Today on the West Coast, surf is fun at 3 ft @5s WNW with fresh 14 mph WSW winds. Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay are your best bets, cleanest early. Tomorrow, swell builds to 6 ft @7s NW, still with fresh winds, so expect some solid waves at spots like Balephetrish. Day after, conditions ease slightly with 4 ft @8s WNW, making it a bit more manageable at sheltered corners. Best: tomorrow.
