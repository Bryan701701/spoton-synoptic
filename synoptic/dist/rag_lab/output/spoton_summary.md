Today on the West Coast, it's looking solid with 6 ft @ 7s NNW and fresh 18 mph NNW winds. Balephetrish and Balevullin Bay are clean and working well, especially during the tide windows. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @ 6s NW, but still offers some fun at the same spots. Day after, conditions remain similar with 4 ft @ 6s NW, but winds ease slightly to 14 mph, making it a bit more manageable. Best: today.
