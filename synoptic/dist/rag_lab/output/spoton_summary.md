Today on the West Coast, it's looking good with 4 ft @ 11s WNW swell and light 5 mph NNW winds. Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay are both clean and fun, especially during their best tide windows. Tomorrow, swell picks up to 6 ft @ 12s but with fresh 13 mph S winds, making it a bit choppy. The day after, conditions drop to 4 ft @ 6s with strong 32 mph SSE winds, likely making it blown out. Best: today.
