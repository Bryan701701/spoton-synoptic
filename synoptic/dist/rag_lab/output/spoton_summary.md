Today on the West Coast, it’s a solid 7 ft @ 14s WNW with a light 12 mph S wind. Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay are your top picks, offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 3 ft @ 10s WSW, still workable but less punchy, with the same wind. The day after, expect 4 ft @ 10s W but fresh 20 mph SSW winds will make it blown out. Best: today.
