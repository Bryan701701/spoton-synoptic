Today on the West Coast, surf is fun at 2 ft @9s W with fresh 17 mph E winds. Ardnave Bay and Saligo Bay are your best bets, offering clean conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow sees a drop to 1 ft @9s WNW, so it’s looking quiet. The day after, conditions worsen with 6 ft @7s NW but strong 28 mph NNW winds will make it blown out. Best: today.
