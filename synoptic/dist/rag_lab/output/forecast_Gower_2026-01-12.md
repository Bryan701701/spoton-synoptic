Today, Gower is lighting up with solid 7 ft @9s WSW swell and fresh 18 mph SSW winds. Broughton Bay and Llangennith Beach are your go-to spots, both offering fun conditions throughout the day. Tomorrow, the swell drops to 4 ft @9s with moderate 14 mph SE winds, still workable at the same locations. By the day after, things ease further to 3 ft @9s with light 9 mph WNW winds, making for a pleasant surf day. Best: today.
